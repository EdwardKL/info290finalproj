1,5,The Pike Place Market favorite has opened a 2nd location in the University District to serve the University of Washington students & staff.  This is a larger sit-down restaurant compared to the small take-out location at the market.  The owner, Yacob Gazaee, was the cook for the Mediterranean Kitchen in Bellevue and formerly in Queen Anne for 6 years.

If you love garlic this is the place!  Falafel, gyros, chicken & lamb shawarma, shish tawook, dajaj mishwi, kafta kabob, spanakopita, hummous, zahra, baba ghanuje, & baklawa.

I had the lamb shawarma & lentil soup.  $9 seems to be the average for a full-meal.
2,5,Yep, I'm a regular.  The variety of material is awesome.  But half the fun is talking to people and listening to others.  I first started going there when the Ron Paul campaigning was going strong here in Austin.  It was a blast, a place where like minded people could relate.  
The guys working there are very, very nice. 
 
One really cool thing, is the guys gave me free DVD's of Aaron Russo's  "Freedom to Fascism"  I got to pass out a bunch 
   at the Travis Co. GOP Convention, 
   at the GOP state convention in Houston
    Also we  put some into the fireman's  boots at the street lights.  .  (Thanks Harlen!)  

My friends and I go every Friday night for underground bible study.  Dwayne is our teacher, and he is awesome.  He knows how to rightly divide the word of truth of the gospel of Christ.    New people show up every week.  We use the KJV and really encourage others to so as well.  It is the pure, inspired, AND preserved word of God.
Thanks again to the guys that work there.  
They have just recently set up the meeting room to go live on-line.  So when they have guest speakers, like Tex Marrs, Alex Jones, Dr. Griffin, ect, now you will be able to go on line and watch the speakers.

Go by and see for yourself how very interesting of a place it is.
3,3,Actually located near the 30th St Station, the Dunkin Donuts is a great place to pick up a quick fast donut and coffee for the morning commuters.  Never had a problem with them - they're fast, efficient, and relatively cheap.
4,4,Get ready for more out of town reviews from me.
Pod is a 3.5 star place, just as the Average Rating suggests.

4 stars for decor: yay for the chairs, the lights, and the martini-sipping well dressed crowd on a thursday night, but nay for the all-metal bathrooms that tried to go too futuristic.

5 stars for service: our waitress was attentive, answered q's, and  most importantly was very professional when my friend realized she had ordered the wrong sushi rolls...and left us with the "wrong" food for free. So in the end we did get the right amount of food for our money!

3 stars for price 

4 stars for food: i highly recommend the U love salmon2.0 rolls! (Smoked salmon wrapped tasmanian salmon and mango maki served with soy glaze and mango cream sauce). If you're not at the sushi bar, make sure to ask for a separate sushi menu so you're not limited to the combos (read: more expensive/complicated sushi) on the regular menu.

If I lived in Philly, I wouldn't return too soon, but I was happy to find a decent restaurant in University City on our one night in town.
5,3,Who knew there was a splash cafe in SLO? This guy didn't. 

Dropped in on a saturday night (still early). They were busy, but no lines out the door.n

The places not big, but there is seating. 
They bake the bread at this location for their shop, and the Splash down in Pismo.
I had the chowder, but not in the bread bowl, just a bowl, but it was good. The chowder had chunks of clams, it was thick, meaty, etc.
I also tried the steamer, which was a dozen steamed clams. But they are mixed in with fresh garlic, and a chunky tomato sauce. Delicious.  It's off the beaten path, but a great alternative to the Splash in Pismo, same food, w/o the lines or wait.
6,4,This is a well stocked Japanese grocery, with everything from snacks to instant noodles and frozen foods.  Go here if you can't go to Kotobukiya in Porter Sq.  Looks old from the outside, but you should come in and check it out.
7,4,Crispy rice spicy tuna rocks at this place.  Have been going here for 2 years now and never disappointed.  Its a great family destination as well.  The atmosphere is nice and clean.  Servers are usually very accommodating as well.
8,3,Adelino's is the newest resident of the downtown location formerly home to Maize. I had initially heard that it was a tapas restaurant, and then later that it was Italian, which I guess were both right as it was Mediterranean tapas. The restauant's decor was nice - slightly dim with kind of an Italian vinyard feel. The only downside I noticed was that it was really hot in the dining area. 

For those unfamiliar with tapas, the idea is that you get several small dishes and everyone shares. Adelino's offers most of their entrees in small, tapas size which ranged in price from around $8 to around $13, as well as a larger family size for $30-$45 that would serve several. 

Probably the most positive part of this place for me was the size and variety of the menu. There were many simple vegetable dishes, pastas, and some less ordinary seafood and meat items like swordfish and duckling. Additionally there are weekly specials, such as "Pizza and a pitcher monday", which we got. 
On the downside, while the food looked pretty, it wasn't as tasty as the prices might have suggested. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad by any means, but I think $25 toward a pizza and pitcher would have been better spent at Puccini's or Bruno's. Adelino's pizza was large, in a deep dish configuration with 8 slices, but was mostly dough with a thin sauce and very little toppings. The other dishes we got were similarly good, but not great. The Mahi-mahi came with two small skewers of grilled fish with a sweet, red sauce served over diced cucumbers, tomatoes and onions. The shrimp pasta was a larger portion, and again, good, but not excellent. 

Overall, Adelino's is a cool restaurant. It's got a good vibe and friendly staff. A place like this would be ideal for a first date, a special occasion or a starting point for a payday celebration evening with some friends. I wouldn't eat here regularly, and personally if I was dropping this much money I would go somewhere with food I enjoyed more, but Adelino's offers enough options to please someone in every group and could add some variety in your downtown dining routine.
9,4,A small, but well-stocked  neighborhood Spec's location. As is typical of this chain, the employees are quite knowlegable of the products and can always help you find what you're looking for (or at least a close substitute!)

This location has anything you'd need for a standard party. They even have a decent cigar selection.
10,4,Your quitessential sports bar filled brand new flat screen TVs and a clean atmosphere thanks to the fact that it is rather new.  In fact, every table has a flat screen TV.  The old Barney's Beanery, although awesome, smells like mildew and spilt beer. The beer here is reasonably priced, around $5-$7, and they have a ton of beers on tap.  

For UCLA students, you can always order food for $5, although none of it looks appetizing.  Come to trivia nights here. It makes for a good time with a group of friends.  Also, this is a great place to come to watch a sports game!
11,5,I ADORE Cambridge Bicycle.  I love the staff - I've been there 6 or 7 times and each time have found them extremely polite, friendly, and helpful.  

The guy who trues bicycle wheels did an awesome job on mine after I got hit by a car (okay, I was driving the car and ran into my own bike... long story...) and restored it to nearly-new condition.  Plus, they included the truing in the tune-up price which I found to be totally reasonable.  I think it was $45.  I also asked them whether I should get the more expensive tune-up, and they checked out my bike and said, "You probably don't need it," instead of milking me.  Yay honesty!

They also have a good assortment of bike accessories, bags, helmets, reflectors, etc. etc.  But mostly I just enjoy going there and getting the royal treatment from their staff.
12,4,I kind of would like to give this place a 3.5, but I can't so I'll give it a 4.  One thing to note, is that if you don't like to drink, you can probably knock off another star 'cause part of what makes this place so great are the cheap draft beers, margaritas and sangria.  How cheap? You can get a half pitcher of sangria here for $7, and it's good too.  Dos Equis amber on draft for $4 ($2 during happy hour).  Decent margaritas that top out at like $7.  So yeah, it's a good place to drink.  

How's the food?  You know, it's not bad and most dishes are in the $8-$12 range.  The mole sauce is good, so chicken mole soft tacos are always a safe bet.  The Chorizo quesadilla is a pretty good choice as well.  I've also had the fajitas and burritos here, but they're sometimes a little on the dry side (overall, not the meat specifically) for me, so I tend to just stick to saucier dishes that I know I'll like.  I'm a sucker for spanish rice and refried beans, so I can't tell you if they're actually any good or not, but they satisfy me.  They don't serve dessert as far as I can tell, but it's right across the street from Madeliine's so you can always just head on over after dinner for something sweet. 

At the end of the day, the reason why I wind up at Taqueria on any given night is that I just can't decide where else I'd rather go.  I'm never disappointed.
13,4,There are some pretty good stuff at this place. It's cash only.

Their salads are in the fridge, pre-made, but they're pretty good. Although I've only had the Salmon burger one, which was amazing. The dressings are on the side. They also have pre-made pasta that are very tasty, but a little more greasy than I would like them to be.

Their sandwich are great, around the average sandwich price in the neighborhood. Can't say they're the best in the neighborhood, but they're close.

Now, their catered food... it's a totally different animal. Their cater food is pretty damn amazing. You don't really get these at the storefront. If you think their sandwich is great the storefront, their catered sandwich is even better. Oh and their dessert... brownies and lemon bars - SO GOOD. The storefront ones are good too, but it doesn't have that fresh catered taste.

The seating by the Cafe is a little meh, not because it's always packed, but the setup just feels a little awkward like the lunch tables from elementary school (Not saying that they have them, just feels like it).

Awesome food, great staff (they're very nice even if you're a sandwich nazi - so be nice to them!), and the price is decent. I can't speak for the catering pricing though. The decor? Well, it's under Avery - the architecture school so it always look like something is happening to the space, which can prove interesting at times.
14,1,Whatever you do, do NOT piss off the owner/manager. I can't be sure that it wasn't just someone who worked there but man, the way he acted, he better have been the manager.

We had ordered our food after the man impatiently asked us what we wanted.  Once we sat down to eat, the man answers the business phone from behind the counter and starts screaming and swearing into the phone at someone: "WHY YOU EFF WITH ME?!?" He walks into the back kitchen and continues but that only made his yelling and swearing echo louder. He then slammed the phone down and came out to the front and began to angrily wipe down the tables and slamming the chairs in. There was another couple there who also kept silent and looked over at us. My boyfriend and I ate as quickly as we could and ran out of there. 

The sandwiches we got weren't even good. Needless to say, we're never coming back.
15,1,The pretzels taste like cheap white bread. The cheese sauce tastes like velveeta. The decor looks like they put a pushcart vendor indoors.
16,4,Need to have a belly full of teriyaki on the cheap? Mako offers lots of bang for the buck. Don't take a date here unless you want to drive home the point that cheap eats is how you roll ("and by the way, howzabout going Dutch?"). Mako edges Yoshinoya out, IMHO.
17,5,I'm normally not in Claremont, but decided to check out the downtown area with some relatives who live in the area.  We stumbled upon this delightful wine shop and I was floored.  They have an extensive wine selection, comfortable yet sheik atmosphere, and a wonderful wait staff.  Other places have wine snobs for employees, but Packing House is different.

I had a chance to talk to the owner, and he was friendly, engaging, and a great story teller.  I never felt that he was over-bearing or anything.  Just a genuinely nice guy.  And more importantly, his guy definitely knows his wine.  All his recommendations were superb.  

All in all, a great experience.
18,4,Great place for a unique and interesting lunch.  Wish it was open for dinner.  I love their wraps.  Unfortunately, I drove past this place for about 6 months before actually stopping in - very unassuming exterior in a tired, worn out shopping center that doesn't have much else in it.
19,5,Oh, L.A. Burdick, you are a keeper!  Sure, you can expect delicious chocolate delights lining the walls (it IS a chocolate store), but what rather attracts me to this place is the whole chillax/romantic cafe vibe.  This place has a cute-chocolatier-meets-barista feel to it all.  Expect small cafe tables and friendly chit-chat from your neighbors.  If you feel like Finale is too formal/intimate for an after-dinner-date winddown, come here instead!

I highly recommend getting the dark hot chocolate!  You think you know what you're expecting, but you have nooo idea.  It is SO worth it.  Drink it before it gets cold.
20,3,This place is really hit or miss these days. 

I feel like this place gets so many positive reviews because it cannot be compared to anywhere else since its the only ice cream cookie sandwich place in the area. 

BUT...compare this place to itself from the first few weeks of its opening to today, and I am sure there wouldnt be too many people that would agree its still the same.

The most obvious, price went up 50 cents. Now to a lot of people, 2 bucks for 2 cookies and a scoop of ice cream is nothing to complain about....BUT the cookies are now smaller and not as fresh and the scoop of ice cream has decreased in size as well. So those of us, or maybe just me, who came to this place during its first month of business and got an overall larger ice cream sandwich for just a $1.50 now become a little disappointed.

I'm not saying I don't enjoy this place any less, the sandwiches still hit the spot when I get that craving for something really sweet late-night, but to me, it's clear that CREAM is slowly adapting to quantity over quality.
21,4,Even though Rachael Ray may have popularized the term EVOO, this isn't a 30-Minute Meal caliber place. It's much better.

EVOO's offerings on the blustery night we went were spot on. The turnip soup (which is vegetarian if you ask them to omit the lamb bacon) was just the thing to get me going again. The poached sous vide egg that came with the soup was perfect; all the yolk was still runny.

I had the potato-crusted winter vegetable gratin as my entree. There was more liquid than I would have expected in a gratin, but it was still creamy and delicious. 

Dessert was parsnip cake with coffee ice cream and toffee sauce. I couldn't tell the cake had parsnips in it at all, but it worked nicely with the ice cream and sauce. The ice cream was especially nice. The toasted rosemary pound cake with sun choke ice cream was also delightful.

The service was efficient and polite, but not really that welcoming. The portions might seem small, but if you opt for the three-course prix fixe, your belly will be more than happy at the end. Given the price and the limited vegetarian offerings (only one entree, and one/two starters), though, I think this is a once-a-season type place.
22,4,Wow...Love the new spot across the street from the old place. They managed to pull off a complicated move in a very short time. This location is cleaner and more polished than the old one, with a more sophisticated look, yet it still retains the earthy, laid back atmosphere of the old spot. While I was there, at least 5 people walked in and said what I just said. 
"Wow."
23,4,I like the ambience here and the location sure is convenient.  Try the roast rabbit.  Order several tapas and share with your table.  The tequila bar is a gift in and of itself.
24,4,I went here on St. Patricks Day and had a few beers. Beer was good, service was good. But they didnt serve Irish Carbombs. Menu looked good, but we didnt eat! I will be back!
25,5,OMG its two blocks from where I stay in Harlem. I had four yes four oatmeal cookies all to my self in the past two days. Crunchy on the outside chewy in the inside. Almost fainted when I had a batch from the oven. They retail for $4 a pop but its worth it trust me on this.
26,3,staff was friendly but a little slow
27,2,This place is cute I guess, but no, I don't like being told the wait is 20 minutes, then having to wait over an hour to finally sit down. The food was okay, but just that. 
I did get their take out the other day and it was also okay. I think what made me go back there was how convenient it is. 
Don't wear anything fancy when you go.. you will end up smelling like you were the one frying eggs in the kitchen.
28,3,The three stars are for the bar closing on a sat night at 11pm. I was more than a little surprised, typically a hotel bar will remain open if there are multiple guests enjoying the night, aka..spending money!!! The drinks were good, even the Sangria is pretty good. The food was average and the staff were hit or miss, moody blues type service. 

This is a great place if your just waiting for someone and grabbing a drink but I definitely suggest meandering else where for your night.
29,2,We've been there a few times and it's good for a quick cupcake. The flavors and presentation have been good but felt they were a bit high in sugar and lacking some balance. I enjoyed seeing them win Cupcake Wars and think the family is pretty cool but we're not driving out of our way to get a cupcake there.
30,1,AWFUL!! Really terrible. I went in for a wax, and asked the price. They said $30. After I was done, I realized the woman did not do a complete job. I tried to explain to her what I wanted, and she basically refused to listen. Then when I came out to pay, they charged me $48!!! No amount of explanation on my part that a) They originally quoted me $30, and b)The woman didn't even give me the correct wax, and in fact, did less than I expected, would get them to understand. They said something to each other and then stood adamantly asking me for $48. Ridiculous. Never going back there again.
31,4,So me and my broseph were looking to get some pizza and saw this place was close to our destination for later that night..

We got some buffalo chicken pizza which was a tad salty but in my opinion was very good. I love the crust here MMMM!! and it had a good spice which makes all the difference. And they have PBR on taP for all those beer cheapos out there :)

And the waitress was super nice and checked on us often even though we were outisde. YES theyhqve outdoor seating = huge win.

Oh and they have HOOKAH. yet another win.  

Parking is street and costs money = fail.

Why did I do a win/fail themed review? I don't know.

I would say try it and have fun but don't expect the best thing ever.

32,3,Ever since we left that decade "the 80s," the Ruggles chain has averaged a solid three stars.  This one is a decent three and a half.  Its bistro-ness screams 80s.  I feel like I should be wearing a large jewel-toned top cinched with a big belt, over stirrup pants and heels...oh wait that's back, isn't it?   I suppose the recipes are a little out-dated, but they do introduce some new items on occasion.  They don't absolutely and completely rest on their laurels of yesteryear, like some restaurant gone to seed.  The have some good, most notably, their desserts.

One of these recent additions has been the Strawberry Bomb.  Sponge cake, mascarpone, and sliced strawberries.  LIght, but not evaporate if you inhale light, and full of flavor.  My perennial favorite is the Domino Cake.  Milk chocolate and white chocolate mousse.  Chocolate cake.  The only demerits it gets is the chocolate ganache covering.  I dislike ganache; it's rubbery.  The remainder of the varied assortment of desserts fills the gigantic display case which is cleverly right next to the place you order.  Bastards.

There is a definite flow of "type of diner" here.  The lunch crowd (eg-ladies who lunch) blends into the ladies who lunch, then drink a glass or more of wine, which blends into the "people from Rice" crew.  Profesor-types and a large number of students.

I stopped in recently in need of a sandwich while "running errands" (shopping in the village).  I'd never eaten food food here, so i was uncertain which route to take: salad or sandwich.  I actually took a sharp left turn and got neither.  Approaching the counter, I noticed one of the day's specials.  A half chicken wrap with avocado, romaine, and tomatoes, accompanied with a cup of fresh vegetable soup.  It was really the soup that caught my eye.  It was full of fresh veggies.  Whole chunks of cauliflower, carrots, tomatoes, ect.  Both the wrap and the soup were simple and fresh and full of flavor because of it.  

I placed my order, grabbed my drink cup to pour my own drink, and my "order is ready" alerter/buzzer buzzed at me.  I know this was the special of the day and there were a few pre-packaged, but golly.  They certainly don't dillydally here.  My meal was a bit pricey ($10 with a drink) for the size, but almost totally worth it for the freshness and expediency of the staff.
33,3,I loved the fresh baked naan.  I love naan in general so i was hooked at this place.  And the fact that they use real tandori ovens was pretty cool.  The only minor complaint that I had was that the place was a little dirty.  Come on, if you have a restaurant respect the food and clean up the place and make it look nice.
