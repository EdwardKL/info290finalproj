1,5,"The Pike Place Market favorite has opened a 2nd location in the University District to serve the University of Washington students & staff.  This is a larger sit-down restaurant compared to the small take-out location at the market.  The owner, Yacob Gazaee, was the cook for the Mediterranean Kitchen in Bellevue and formerly in Queen Anne for 6 years.

If you love garlic this is the place!  Falafel, gyros, chicken & lamb shawarma, shish tawook, dajaj mishwi, kafta kabob, spanakopita, hummous, zahra, baba ghanuje, & baklawa.

I had the lamb shawarma & lentil soup.  $9 seems to be the average for a full-meal."
2,5,"Yep, I'm a regular.  The variety of material is awesome.  But half the fun is talking to people and listening to others.  I first started going there when the Ron Paul campaigning was going strong here in Austin.  It was a blast, a place where like minded people could relate.  
The guys working there are very, very nice. 
 
One really cool thing, is the guys gave me free DVD's of Aaron Russo's  ""Freedom to Fascism""  I got to pass out a bunch 
   at the Travis Co. GOP Convention, 
   at the GOP state convention in Houston
    Also we  put some into the fireman's  boots at the street lights.  .  (Thanks Harlen!)  

My friends and I go every Friday night for underground bible study.  Dwayne is our teacher, and he is awesome.  He knows how to rightly divide the word of truth of the gospel of Christ.    New people show up every week.  We use the KJV and really encourage others to so as well.  It is the pure, inspired, AND preserved word of God.
Thanks again to the guys that work there.  
They have just recently set up the meeting room to go live on-line.  So when they have guest speakers, like Tex Marrs, Alex Jones, Dr. Griffin, ect, now you will be able to go on line and watch the speakers.

Go by and see for yourself how very interesting of a place it is."
3,3,"Actually located near the 30th St Station, the Dunkin Donuts is a great place to pick up a quick fast donut and coffee for the morning commuters.  Never had a problem with them - they're fast, efficient, and relatively cheap."
4,4,"Get ready for more out of town reviews from me.
Pod is a 3.5 star place, just as the Average Rating suggests.

4 stars for decor: yay for the chairs, the lights, and the martini-sipping well dressed crowd on a thursday night, but nay for the all-metal bathrooms that tried to go too futuristic.

5 stars for service: our waitress was attentive, answered q's, and  most importantly was very professional when my friend realized she had ordered the wrong sushi rolls...and left us with the ""wrong"" food for free. So in the end we did get the right amount of food for our money!

3 stars for price 

4 stars for food: i highly recommend the U love salmon2.0 rolls! (Smoked salmon wrapped tasmanian salmon and mango maki served with soy glaze and mango cream sauce). If you're not at the sushi bar, make sure to ask for a separate sushi menu so you're not limited to the combos (read: more expensive/complicated sushi) on the regular menu.

If I lived in Philly, I wouldn't return too soon, but I was happy to find a decent restaurant in University City on our one night in town."
5,3,"Who knew there was a splash cafe in SLO? This guy didn't. 

Dropped in on a saturday night (still early). They were busy, but no lines out the door.n

The places not big, but there is seating. 
They bake the bread at this location for their shop, and the Splash down in Pismo.
I had the chowder, but not in the bread bowl, just a bowl, but it was good. The chowder had chunks of clams, it was thick, meaty, etc.
I also tried the steamer, which was a dozen steamed clams. But they are mixed in with fresh garlic, and a chunky tomato sauce. Delicious.  It's off the beaten path, but a great alternative to the Splash in Pismo, same food, w/o the lines or wait."
6,4,"This is a well stocked Japanese grocery, with everything from snacks to instant noodles and frozen foods.  Go here if you can't go to Kotobukiya in Porter Sq.  Looks old from the outside, but you should come in and check it out."
7,4,Crispy rice spicy tuna rocks at this place.  Have been going here for 2 years now and never disappointed.  Its a great family destination as well.  The atmosphere is nice and clean.  Servers are usually very accommodating as well.
8,3,"Adelino's is the newest resident of the downtown location formerly home to Maize. I had initially heard that it was a tapas restaurant, and then later that it was Italian, which I guess were both right as it was Mediterranean tapas. The restauant's decor was nice - slightly dim with kind of an Italian vinyard feel. The only downside I noticed was that it was really hot in the dining area. 

For those unfamiliar with tapas, the idea is that you get several small dishes and everyone shares. Adelino's offers most of their entrees in small, tapas size which ranged in price from around $8 to around $13, as well as a larger family size for $30-$45 that would serve several. 

Probably the most positive part of this place for me was the size and variety of the menu. There were many simple vegetable dishes, pastas, and some less ordinary seafood and meat items like swordfish and duckling. Additionally there are weekly specials, such as ""Pizza and a pitcher monday"", which we got. 
On the downside, while the food looked pretty, it wasn't as tasty as the prices might have suggested. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad by any means, but I think $25 toward a pizza and pitcher would have been better spent at Puccini's or Bruno's. Adelino's pizza was large, in a deep dish configuration with 8 slices, but was mostly dough with a thin sauce and very little toppings. The other dishes we got were similarly good, but not great. The Mahi-mahi came with two small skewers of grilled fish with a sweet, red sauce served over diced cucumbers, tomatoes and onions. The shrimp pasta was a larger portion, and again, good, but not excellent. 

Overall, Adelino's is a cool restaurant. It's got a good vibe and friendly staff. A place like this would be ideal for a first date, a special occasion or a starting point for a payday celebration evening with some friends. I wouldn't eat here regularly, and personally if I was dropping this much money I would go somewhere with food I enjoyed more, but Adelino's offers enough options to please someone in every group and could add some variety in your downtown dining routine."
9,4,"A small, but well-stocked  neighborhood Spec's location. As is typical of this chain, the employees are quite knowlegable of the products and can always help you find what you're looking for (or at least a close substitute!)

This location has anything you'd need for a standard party. They even have a decent cigar selection."
10,4,"Your quitessential sports bar filled brand new flat screen TVs and a clean atmosphere thanks to the fact that it is rather new.  In fact, every table has a flat screen TV.  The old Barney's Beanery, although awesome, smells like mildew and spilt beer. The beer here is reasonably priced, around $5-$7, and they have a ton of beers on tap.  

For UCLA students, you can always order food for $5, although none of it looks appetizing.  Come to trivia nights here. It makes for a good time with a group of friends.  Also, this is a great place to come to watch a sports game!"
11,5,"I ADORE Cambridge Bicycle.  I love the staff - I've been there 6 or 7 times and each time have found them extremely polite, friendly, and helpful.  

The guy who trues bicycle wheels did an awesome job on mine after I got hit by a car (okay, I was driving the car and ran into my own bike... long story...) and restored it to nearly-new condition.  Plus, they included the truing in the tune-up price which I found to be totally reasonable.  I think it was $45.  I also asked them whether I should get the more expensive tune-up, and they checked out my bike and said, ""You probably don't need it,"" instead of milking me.  Yay honesty!

They also have a good assortment of bike accessories, bags, helmets, reflectors, etc. etc.  But mostly I just enjoy going there and getting the royal treatment from their staff."
12,4,"I kind of would like to give this place a 3.5, but I can't so I'll give it a 4.  One thing to note, is that if you don't like to drink, you can probably knock off another star 'cause part of what makes this place so great are the cheap draft beers, margaritas and sangria.  How cheap? You can get a half pitcher of sangria here for $7, and it's good too.  Dos Equis amber on draft for $4 ($2 during happy hour).  Decent margaritas that top out at like $7.  So yeah, it's a good place to drink.  

How's the food?  You know, it's not bad and most dishes are in the $8-$12 range.  The mole sauce is good, so chicken mole soft tacos are always a safe bet.  The Chorizo quesadilla is a pretty good choice as well.  I've also had the fajitas and burritos here, but they're sometimes a little on the dry side (overall, not the meat specifically) for me, so I tend to just stick to saucier dishes that I know I'll like.  I'm a sucker for spanish rice and refried beans, so I can't tell you if they're actually any good or not, but they satisfy me.  They don't serve dessert as far as I can tell, but it's right across the street from Madeliine's so you can always just head on over after dinner for something sweet. 

At the end of the day, the reason why I wind up at Taqueria on any given night is that I just can't decide where else I'd rather go.  I'm never disappointed."
13,4,"There are some pretty good stuff at this place. It's cash only.

Their salads are in the fridge, pre-made, but they're pretty good. Although I've only had the Salmon burger one, which was amazing. The dressings are on the side. They also have pre-made pasta that are very tasty, but a little more greasy than I would like them to be.

Their sandwich are great, around the average sandwich price in the neighborhood. Can't say they're the best in the neighborhood, but they're close.

Now, their catered food... it's a totally different animal. Their cater food is pretty damn amazing. You don't really get these at the storefront. If you think their sandwich is great the storefront, their catered sandwich is even better. Oh and their dessert... brownies and lemon bars - SO GOOD. The storefront ones are good too, but it doesn't have that fresh catered taste.

The seating by the Cafe is a little meh, not because it's always packed, but the setup just feels a little awkward like the lunch tables from elementary school (Not saying that they have them, just feels like it).

Awesome food, great staff (they're very nice even if you're a sandwich nazi - so be nice to them!), and the price is decent. I can't speak for the catering pricing though. The decor? Well, it's under Avery - the architecture school so it always look like something is happening to the space, which can prove interesting at times."
14,1,"Whatever you do, do NOT piss off the owner/manager. I can't be sure that it wasn't just someone who worked there but man, the way he acted, he better have been the manager.

We had ordered our food after the man impatiently asked us what we wanted.  Once we sat down to eat, the man answers the business phone from behind the counter and starts screaming and swearing into the phone at someone: ""WHY YOU EFF WITH ME?!?"" He walks into the back kitchen and continues but that only made his yelling and swearing echo louder. He then slammed the phone down and came out to the front and began to angrily wipe down the tables and slamming the chairs in. There was another couple there who also kept silent and looked over at us. My boyfriend and I ate as quickly as we could and ran out of there. 

The sandwiches we got weren't even good. Needless to say, we're never coming back."
15,1,The pretzels taste like cheap white bread. The cheese sauce tastes like velveeta. The decor looks like they put a pushcart vendor indoors.
16,4,"Need to have a belly full of teriyaki on the cheap? Mako offers lots of bang for the buck. Don't take a date here unless you want to drive home the point that cheap eats is how you roll (""and by the way, howzabout going Dutch?""). Mako edges Yoshinoya out, IMHO."
17,5,"I'm normally not in Claremont, but decided to check out the downtown area with some relatives who live in the area.  We stumbled upon this delightful wine shop and I was floored.  They have an extensive wine selection, comfortable yet sheik atmosphere, and a wonderful wait staff.  Other places have wine snobs for employees, but Packing House is different.

I had a chance to talk to the owner, and he was friendly, engaging, and a great story teller.  I never felt that he was over-bearing or anything.  Just a genuinely nice guy.  And more importantly, his guy definitely knows his wine.  All his recommendations were superb.  

All in all, a great experience."
18,4,"Great place for a unique and interesting lunch.  Wish it was open for dinner.  I love their wraps.  Unfortunately, I drove past this place for about 6 months before actually stopping in - very unassuming exterior in a tired, worn out shopping center that doesn't have much else in it."
19,5,"Oh, L.A. Burdick, you are a keeper!  Sure, you can expect delicious chocolate delights lining the walls (it IS a chocolate store), but what rather attracts me to this place is the whole chillax/romantic cafe vibe.  This place has a cute-chocolatier-meets-barista feel to it all.  Expect small cafe tables and friendly chit-chat from your neighbors.  If you feel like Finale is too formal/intimate for an after-dinner-date winddown, come here instead!

I highly recommend getting the dark hot chocolate!  You think you know what you're expecting, but you have nooo idea.  It is SO worth it.  Drink it before it gets cold."
20,3,"This place is really hit or miss these days. 

I feel like this place gets so many positive reviews because it cannot be compared to anywhere else since its the only ice cream cookie sandwich place in the area. 

BUT...compare this place to itself from the first few weeks of its opening to today, and I am sure there wouldnt be too many people that would agree its still the same.

The most obvious, price went up 50 cents. Now to a lot of people, 2 bucks for 2 cookies and a scoop of ice cream is nothing to complain about....BUT the cookies are now smaller and not as fresh and the scoop of ice cream has decreased in size as well. So those of us, or maybe just me, who came to this place during its first month of business and got an overall larger ice cream sandwich for just a $1.50 now become a little disappointed.

I'm not saying I don't enjoy this place any less, the sandwiches still hit the spot when I get that craving for something really sweet late-night, but to me, it's clear that CREAM is slowly adapting to quantity over quality."
21,4,"Even though Rachael Ray may have popularized the term EVOO, this isn't a 30-Minute Meal caliber place. It's much better.

EVOO's offerings on the blustery night we went were spot on. The turnip soup (which is vegetarian if you ask them to omit the lamb bacon) was just the thing to get me going again. The poached sous vide egg that came with the soup was perfect; all the yolk was still runny.

I had the potato-crusted winter vegetable gratin as my entree. There was more liquid than I would have expected in a gratin, but it was still creamy and delicious. 

Dessert was parsnip cake with coffee ice cream and toffee sauce. I couldn't tell the cake had parsnips in it at all, but it worked nicely with the ice cream and sauce. The ice cream was especially nice. The toasted rosemary pound cake with sun choke ice cream was also delightful.

The service was efficient and polite, but not really that welcoming. The portions might seem small, but if you opt for the three-course prix fixe, your belly will be more than happy at the end. Given the price and the limited vegetarian offerings (only one entree, and one/two starters), though, I think this is a once-a-season type place."
22,4,"Wow...Love the new spot across the street from the old place. They managed to pull off a complicated move in a very short time. This location is cleaner and more polished than the old one, with a more sophisticated look, yet it still retains the earthy, laid back atmosphere of the old spot. While I was there, at least 5 people walked in and said what I just said. 
""Wow."""
23,4,I like the ambience here and the location sure is convenient.  Try the roast rabbit.  Order several tapas and share with your table.  The tequila bar is a gift in and of itself.
24,4,"I went here on St. Patricks Day and had a few beers. Beer was good, service was good. But they didnt serve Irish Carbombs. Menu looked good, but we didnt eat! I will be back!"
25,5,OMG its two blocks from where I stay in Harlem. I had four yes four oatmeal cookies all to my self in the past two days. Crunchy on the outside chewy in the inside. Almost fainted when I had a batch from the oven. They retail for $4 a pop but its worth it trust me on this.
26,3,staff was friendly but a little slow
27,2,"This place is cute I guess, but no, I don't like being told the wait is 20 minutes, then having to wait over an hour to finally sit down. The food was okay, but just that. 
I did get their take out the other day and it was also okay. I think what made me go back there was how convenient it is. 
Don't wear anything fancy when you go.. you will end up smelling like you were the one frying eggs in the kitchen."
28,3,"The three stars are for the bar closing on a sat night at 11pm. I was more than a little surprised, typically a hotel bar will remain open if there are multiple guests enjoying the night, aka..spending money!!! The drinks were good, even the Sangria is pretty good. The food was average and the staff were hit or miss, moody blues type service. 

This is a great place if your just waiting for someone and grabbing a drink but I definitely suggest meandering else where for your night."
29,2,We've been there a few times and it's good for a quick cupcake. The flavors and presentation have been good but felt they were a bit high in sugar and lacking some balance. I enjoyed seeing them win Cupcake Wars and think the family is pretty cool but we're not driving out of our way to get a cupcake there.
30,1,"AWFUL!! Really terrible. I went in for a wax, and asked the price. They said $30. After I was done, I realized the woman did not do a complete job. I tried to explain to her what I wanted, and she basically refused to listen. Then when I came out to pay, they charged me $48!!! No amount of explanation on my part that a) They originally quoted me $30, and b)The woman didn't even give me the correct wax, and in fact, did less than I expected, would get them to understand. They said something to each other and then stood adamantly asking me for $48. Ridiculous. Never going back there again."
31,4,"So me and my broseph were looking to get some pizza and saw this place was close to our destination for later that night..

We got some buffalo chicken pizza which was a tad salty but in my opinion was very good. I love the crust here MMMM!! and it had a good spice which makes all the difference. And they have PBR on taP for all those beer cheapos out there :)

And the waitress was super nice and checked on us often even though we were outisde. YES theyhqve outdoor seating = huge win.

Oh and they have HOOKAH. yet another win.  

Parking is street and costs money = fail.

Why did I do a win/fail themed review? I don't know.

I would say try it and have fun but don't expect the best thing ever.

32,3,"Ever since we left that decade ""the 80s,"" the Ruggles chain has averaged a solid three stars.  This one is a decent three and a half.  Its bistro-ness screams 80s.  I feel like I should be wearing a large jewel-toned top cinched with a big belt, over stirrup pants and heels...oh wait that's back, isn't it?   I suppose the recipes are a little out-dated, but they do introduce some new items on occasion.  They don't absolutely and completely rest on their laurels of yesteryear, like some restaurant gone to seed.  The have some good, most notably, their desserts.

One of these recent additions has been the Strawberry Bomb.  Sponge cake, mascarpone, and sliced strawberries.  LIght, but not evaporate if you inhale light, and full of flavor.  My perennial favorite is the Domino Cake.  Milk chocolate and white chocolate mousse.  Chocolate cake.  The only demerits it gets is the chocolate ganache covering.  I dislike ganache; it's rubbery.  The remainder of the varied assortment of desserts fills the gigantic display case which is cleverly right next to the place you order.  Bastards.

There is a definite flow of ""type of diner"" here.  The lunch crowd (eg-ladies who lunch) blends into the ladies who lunch, then drink a glass or more of wine, which blends into the ""people from Rice"" crew.  Profesor-types and a large number of students.

I stopped in recently in need of a sandwich while ""running errands"" (shopping in the village).  I'd never eaten food food here, so i was uncertain which route to take: salad or sandwich.  I actually took a sharp left turn and got neither.  Approaching the counter, I noticed one of the day's specials.  A half chicken wrap with avocado, romaine, and tomatoes, accompanied with a cup of fresh vegetable soup.  It was really the soup that caught my eye.  It was full of fresh veggies.  Whole chunks of cauliflower, carrots, tomatoes, ect.  Both the wrap and the soup were simple and fresh and full of flavor because of it.  

I placed my order, grabbed my drink cup to pour my own drink, and my ""order is ready"" alerter/buzzer buzzed at me.  I know this was the special of the day and there were a few pre-packaged, but golly.  They certainly don't dillydally here.  My meal was a bit pricey ($10 with a drink) for the size, but almost totally worth it for the freshness and expediency of the staff."
33,3,"I loved the fresh baked naan.  I love naan in general so i was hooked at this place.  And the fact that they use real tandori ovens was pretty cool.  The only minor complaint that I had was that the place was a little dirty.  Come on, if you have a restaurant respect the food and clean up the place and make it look nice."
34,3,"Every college town seems to have a couple of no frills fast food places that are not spectacular but have a strong student following given their history of eating there. Sak's is one of these places along with several others that shares the common threads of selling large meat plates and rice bowls for cheap. Cheap in this case is defined by Westwood standard which by appearance the large portions may lead to the perception of good value but it's still considered expensive with the quality you get. I was running errands at the Village and decided to return to Sak's after a few years of hiatus. 

This hole in the wall is sizable comparing to others in the area. The walkway that follows the entrance leads to the dining area and then the kitchen in the back where the orders are taken. The décor is very minimal and subdued, and the most exciting thing you'll see is their poster menu filled with pictures of their foods. 

I had the chance to try their Teriyaki Chicken and Spicy Chicken Combo ($6.40) that came with two deep fried pot stickers, salad, and mix of charbroiled and deep fried chicken smothered on top of steamed rice that had been seasoned with frozen peas, corn, and chicken fat. The salad was fresh but the wrapper on the pot stickers were way too thin. The rice was one greasy spoon and the mix of chicken was tasty, not spicy, and not in the best shape. Not sure how many times these pot stickers and chicken were fried and refried. The only thing that looked remotely healthy on their menu was their udon with teriyaki chicken, but otherwise my greasy meal was a good reflection of what you'll likely get here. 

Overall, it was a passable meal comprised of large portions and a decent price. I'm trying to avoid Westwood restaurants as much as I possibly can these days, but Sak's is still a viable option for those looking for something quick and easy and don't mind the zero thrills experience. 2.5 stars for the overall experience."
35,5,"Mother's Day Brunch

What's not to love?  The food was exceptional and the service was VIP the entire time.   I had 10 people in our party and the pre-set menu made it so much easier.  Compliments to the Chef and Staff for making Mother's Day a memorable experience for my family.

5 Bite Friday
Unbelievable!  I'm hooked...I have attended 2 months in a row.  The pairing of the wine and menu was spectacular.  I brought  2 different groups of people and both groups loved it and can't wait to attend next month. 

Happy Hour
Do I say more?  Wow...before sitting down for the 5 Bite Friday events, we start with Happy Hour.  Amazing prices, exceptional quality of food, and service.  Get there early because you want to get a seat in the bar and plenty of time to consume an array of cocktails and appetizers.

Brewers Beer Dinner
Like all of their events...this is another one you can't miss!   The menu pairing was over the top.  First Course: Stuffed Organic Squash Blossom & Golden State Ale,  Second Course: Banna Leaf Purse with Pulled Park & Siamese Twin Ale, Third Course: Duet of Lamb & Bacon Brown Ale, & Fourth Course: Black & White Bread Pudding & Baltic Porter.   $45.00 per person...Amazing Price, Food, & Service..can't beat this anywhere!!!"
36,4,"Rather like visiting the original Starbucks in Seattle, it's somewhat anticlimactic to venture to the original Jamba Juice in San Luis Obispo.  It used to be a Juice Club, and you can easily discern why the concept caught on with the lovely students at Cal Poly SLO.  

I walked in expecting to see something a bit significant as it's a very lovely chain now, but I see that it's basically, like any other JJ franchise.  That being said, like most JJ's it will offer you friendly service, healthy options, and delicious flavour.  I was just...I dunno, expecting a bit more.....to-do about the whole damn thing."
37,5,"This place is SUPER cute!!! Love the store, love the area, love my girl Karin! I came for 2 services and let me tell you, she facial'ed to the tip of my head & waxed to the bottom of my Brazilian! ; )

Facial was great and the results were even better! I have to say I never trust anyone with my face, but she reassured me with ease that I wouldn't be disappointed & she was right! My face was glowing all day and even received compliments that day on my skin, (which is crazy, cuz who just comes up to you and says, ""wow, you have really nice skin!""?) Uh, no one. But they sure did that day!

Then I went back for my Brazilian. If she did that for my face, Lord only knows what else she can do with the goods! Without getting into too much graphic detail, it was almost painless. I said almost. She's great, but she's not God! lol! It was actually the most painless Brazilian wax that I've ever gotten and I've been doing it for 10 years. She handled my fragile package with care and those results were meticulous and glowing as well! I would tell you all the compliments I received that day too, but I'm not that kind of girl. ; )    

So to wrap it up, this was a new place I thought I'd try and is now my official place. I'm usually a Peaches & cream girl, but this place has great prices for the quality of services they offer and the quality of people (Karin) that offer them. It's located in the heart of Old town Claremont, so you can get a facial/wax and a bloody mary next door. My two faves!"
38,5,"They always a have a long line but it's worthy to wait it. They do very quick so you don't wait for that long time. I think it's one of the best pizza place in LA comparing the quality and the price. I've already been here several times and my favorite is the specialty pies. They have a good pizza but it's not a place to sit down and talk. When you're done eating, just leave right away. There are always people waiting for the table to sit down."
39,4,"It's only appropriate to go here whilst intoxicated. Even when drunk, I still feel the shame of tottering in but I live right beside it and everything tastes good at 3 in the morning, particularly when its twice the size of one's face."
40,4,"We originally decided to go to Alexander's for an official dinner for a seminar speaker, expecting 15-20 people to come.  So I talked to the manager and he set me all up, despite the fact that I was calling only 3 days before the dinner.  He was so super nice and wonderful.  We wound up only having 5 (who passes up free food?) but it was still a lovely dinner.  The waitress was really helpful in suggesting the best things to get.
  
I agree about the bread...it was just 'meh'.  We didn't get an appetizer, but the homemade salad dressing (ranch) was very (very) good.  I got the special for that night - fresh veal, and it was so so so good.  The waitress said it would melt in your mouth, and it did.  I also got the marfredo sauce on malfada pasta as my pasta side, based on other Yelp reviews of this combination and it was also quite good.  

Overall, great food.  I would definitely return."

42,4,"Hello.  My name is Kiwiberri, and if you like my twin Pink Berry, then you will like me.  I have the same two flavors to offer, plain and green tea, as well as some smoothies.  I am slightly jealous of Pink Berry because she offers a wider selection of toppings, especially the fruit ones, but I do offer the best ones she has to offer.  My price is slightly lower and you can add more toppings with me.  I am fat free, full of calcium goodness, and have that real frozen yogurt tarty, sweet and sour taste (non of that fake sweetener, ice cream like  ""frozen yogurt"").  I know that after meeting me you will become one of my best friends and visit me often.  So come in today and have some yogurt.  Don't worry, Pink Berry won't mind if you visit her less."

I found the place a little hard to spot, but otherwise I thought the event was very successful and really enjoyed the silent auction that showed some quality art work.
Alcoholic beverages were available at the bar and they even had a covered street patio for smokers."
44,3,"Considering it's in a pretty crappy area, I could not give this place more than 3 stars. Additionally, it IS McDonald's. I went to the drive-thru the other morning to get an iced coffee and they were pretty busy (which is good). However, if you are in a hurry and need to get to USC or your work place, I would not recommend coming here because it always seems to be packed. Anyways, its McDonald's. Its not much different than the others."

46,4,"I went for to get a new contact lens prescription because mine had run out and I needed to order more. I chose Bell Vision mostly because they are very conveniently located to where I lived in Pittsburgh.

When I called to make an appointment they where booked for about a week out which I took as a good sign. My only gripe was that is was a bit of a hassle to get all the info I needed for my insurance since the card was at home with my parents. The women on the phone could have been more helpful letting me know what info she needed. It took a couple of tries to get everything but once I did they took my Davis Vision insurance no problem.

The actual eye exam was very good. I have had many eye exams before and he did everything I expected. Dr. Bell was very pleasant and professional.

They also order contact lens for me and billed my insurance for them. They shipped the lens directly to my house, which was a major improvement over places that make you go pick them up.

They might not have the best supply of frames if you are looking to buy a new pair of glasses, but to be honest I did not really look. It is more of a doctors office then a glasses store."
47,3,"I got my order to go - tri-tip sandwich and a side of fries.

Plusses:
1) Tender tri-tip and lots of it
2) Deliciously seasoned french fries - think McDonald's but with some mixture of paprika (and Old Bay perhaps)?

Minuses:
1) Not enough BBQ sauce (even though I had requested extra)
2) Mediocre bread
3) Super long line
4) Nowhere to wait for the to-go order"
48,4,"Mmmmmm wiiings....

It's hard not to love a place that serves delicious wings with a gazillion sauce options, yummy potato wedges, ice cold beer, and TVs in every nook and cranny of the venue!  They definitely know how to pack the place for special sporting events and hold sporadic wing eating contests (after partaking in one myself, I had to down nearly three pitchers of water and rub ice cubes on my tongue for 30 minutes to get rid of the burning sensation that ran from my mouth down my throat).  Oh, but it was well worth it!"
49,4,"This is my first time going to a vegan restaurant. I eat meat, and I enjoy eating meat. So I ordered the chili, primarily because I was curious how it would be made without any animal products. It was delish! Hearty, filling, and great tasting. But I wasn't a big fan of the cornbread. If I am in the area again, I would love to try other things they offer. It seems like a great place that really puts effort into making quality dishes."
50,4,"Progressive, a new definition of noodle bar.

It's refreshing to know such an establishment with such high reviews actually fulfill their word. 
Yelpers recommended the pork buns; and I'm glad I read that. The redux of the standard pork bun was refreshing, even with high fat content; tako-yaki was surprisingly good here too. It's rare to find a Japanese restaurant that even knows what a Tako-yaki is. I'm glad they used the right mayonnaise too. That's very important.

I had the duck Ramen... The stock was perfect. However, the noodles were a bit hard for Ramen. Had a similar ""al dente"" texture that I saw in noodles from Southern Japan.

I ate there at 1AM. The DJ playing loud music while my friends and I want to actually talk was a huge inconvenience. We just left the bars, why can't we calm it down while we eat? Call me old fashioned, but it didn't flow with me.

Food and service were great. 5 stars.
DJ playing extremely loud progressive house brought it down to 4 stars."

In fashion retail, you need 2 out of 3 things:
1.) You like the clothes

So who's got the special sauce for your wardrobe? Louis Boston? No. Barney's New York? No. Saks Fifth Avenue? No.

The best threads are at Tess. Absolutement.

Back when they used to sell Men's, I was so entranced by everything in the store. I bought a lot of stuff there, way more than I should of. Somehow, all of those gorgeous things are missing from my wardrobe. Pretty much all horked by ex-girlfriends. The only thing left? A $950 Biella outerwear coat. Sure, extravagant, (I'm not made of money! At the same time, I have a rule of thumb, ""Anything worth buying is at least a thousand bucks."") but I've had it for oh, 8 years now, I still wear it all the time, and if I had a dollar for every compliment I got for it, it would of paid for itself. Unfortunately, I work it off like everyone else. I still enjoy buying gifts here occasionally.

Make sure your choices are 3 for 3, and you'll never regret shopping here, no matter the cost."
52,4,"The Cambridge area contains more Indian restaurants within 10 square miles than probably any other place on earth. Yet when my family wants Indian, we think ""Central Square Indian"", meaning this place. We've been to other Indian places around and kudos to them but I find this place gives you the best for your buck. 

The best way to enjoy dinner here is with at least three people and a sharing attitude. Start with a vegetarian and non-vegetarian platter to go around, which include tasty pakoras among other things. For main courses I reccomend a rice-based biriyani, a meat-based dish like a saag or spicy vindaloo, and a creamy curry-based dish such as chicken korma. The selection is formidable, so sharing amongst a group is the best way to cover all the bases of this cuisine.

Service is decent, and the prices are cheaper in comparison to other places in the area. Parking is limited, but public transportation is conveniently close. Consider this place when weighing the myriad of options for Cambridge Indian cuisine."
53,4,Fantastic food and service.  Will definitely go back.  From the appetizer to dessert it was absolutely delicious.  Gold Plate.
54,5,"The campus is nice but the area around it looks like an urban sprawl.    Cal football team and women's volleyball team are the best.   For volleyball games, it is free for students and you can sit as close to the courts you want.  
Students here are very smart and you will be competing for your classmates for grades.  Professors here are smart and give you valuable insights so going to lectures is a must.  You must go to Crossroads if you want to eat their dorm foods since it's the best on campus.  The Camponile is a cute place to take your date to.  Expect a lot of events and activities during the day at the Sather Gate area i.e. dance performances, speeches, their world-renowned protests, etc.  The mainstacks is a perfect place to study but don't plan to study there if you're expecting a call since it is underground.
Playing basketball at People's Park is ghetto yet it's fun.  Fights and thefts do happen here so you may need to be a bit street-savvy.  This is the place I improved my street basketball skills other than Oakland.

Go Bears!"

56,1,"NEVER SHOP HERE. My friend and I noticed an ad in the UMass Daily Collegian on a Thursday for a sale on 12-packs of Sierra Nevada. When we asked about the sale the very next day, we were told that it was no longer on sale. When we decided that we didn't want the 12-packs if they weren't on sale and were going to look around something else, we had our IDs thrown back at us with an angry ""Fine."" Needless to say, we left and went to Liquors 44 instead. The very next week in the same ad was ran in the Collegian that 12-packs of Sierra Nevada were on sale. I don't know what the business practices of this liquor store are, but the rudeness was enough so that I will never shop there again. Seriously, if you want the cheapest prices they can probably be found at Liquors 44 and if you want good service and advice, go to Russell's in Amherst Center."
57,4,I went their last night with a friend.  The menu has a wide selection of items.  I had the pecan crusted chicken which was tasty and the accompanying veggies were cooked to perfection.  When we got their it took a very long time for someone to come and seat us even though the restaurant was almost empty but our waiver was friendly and efficient.
58,3,"Staff there are super nice, but the food is slightly overpriced and they don't have free coffee refills, which is also disappointing."
59,1,"We always eat at Sahara or Tiger Noodle when in town, but this night, we said, ""let's try Genteels's before the movie.""  Long story short - the service and the food was pretty bad.  There's only one other table in the place and our high school waitress has an attitude because I asked for my eggplant to be sauteed rather than deep fried.  Next the cook comes to our table and tells my boyfriend that they're out of whatever it was that he ordered.  That's fine, but why is the cook at our table (although I should say he's much more pleasant than the waitress)?  Answer: because the waitress is throwing a tantrum in the back - we can see her from where we're sitting.  So the food arrives and it's subpar at best.  The preparation of the food and the service need to be much improved upon before prices of this kind can be added to any menu."

61,5,"Tekgnar is Laurie Pevey's skate shop, which prior to moving to its current location at MLK was situated at Rio Grande and 5th and called Blondie's.

Now I'm not much a skater myself, but when I decided a few years ago that a longboard would be a welcome addition to my personal transportation arsenal I walked into Tekgnar after a movie at the Dobie and told the couple of guys working the store at the time what I was looking to get out of a skateboard.  After a brief and very friendly and helpful consultation and about 15 minutes' worth of assembly time I walked out and subsequently skated away as the proud owner of a 4ft, all-maplewood Sector 9 Supercruiser with Randall 180 trucks, Lucky Titanium ball bearings and a set of Sector 9 76mm wheels.  I was a happy camper.

I've since gone back to buy two more longboards and those two respective visits have been equally pleasant and successful.

As far as I can tell, they've managed to keep their focus on skate gear.  Apart from decks, trucks, wheels etc, you'll find a pretty wide assortment of skate-appropriate shoes and clothing as well as the obligatory magazines and DVDs.

So upon my personal, anecdotal evidence I'd predict that you won't have endure any attitude by the kind folks working there, even if you are a complete skating virgin and that you'll most likely find what you are looking for, if it's got anything to do with skating (that's skating as in skateboards, not inline or skates, mind you.)"
62,4,"Ryno's, how could you?  How could you raise your prices on me???  AND you took away your stools in the day time.  Do you really expect me to enjoy your froyo outside in chilly Berkeley?  Do you???

You used to be so convenient to sit and hangout at, not to mention cheap.  Those seem to be the only reasons that people even liked you.  Cheap and convenient is how I like my froyo (but not my men!), and Ryno's, you are none of the above.

You're dead to me.

(Okay, truth be told, I'll probably still stop by a couple of times a month.  I'm still upset at the price increase and lack of seating, but I'm weak!)"
63,5,"Holy crap. I wasn't sure what I wanted for lunch so I just browsed Yelp! for the highest rated restaurants. This one pops up and I just want to say...

THANK YOU YELPERS!

I got the beef kabobs and they were so very flavorful. They serve that with pita, hummus, side salad, and rice. Garlic spread/hot sauce. My lord. This is good. Usually at mediterranean places I get gyros or rotisserie chicken... but BEEF KABOBS PLEASE."
64,5,"5 Stars for their customer service.  Although the place is generally packed with state workers trying to satisfy their caffeine craving, the staff is super friendly and keeps the line moving.  I appreciate the personal touches, such as remembering names of frequent patrons, as well as their usual drink order.  

There are times when I order a coffee frap light and receive a caramel frap light instead; however, they are more than happy to replace my drink with a new, and sometimes larger one and also let me keep the original drink.

Excellent customer service will bring me back over, and over."

66,5,"As someone who's lived in quite a few rentals with badly-copied keys, I  appreciate having a really reliable locksmith around. Vogel's was the very first business I patronized after moving to Ann Arbor and the service was excellent. 

They also helped me out after a used furniture store sold me a cabinet that turned out to be locked shut with no key included. When I was unable to return the cabinet (this part is a story for another review...), I thought I was stuck with a giant useless box. The folks at Vogel's found the correct skeleton key to open it up and I happily use it to this day. I love the downtown location too."
67,5,Antico Pizza is the best pizza hands down. We went to Italy this past summer and had to come to Antico a week after returning home for some real delicious Italian wood fired pizza. It's a total logistical pain. You have to wait to find seats at these big tables and then you feel like you're rushed to eat since everyone is waiting for your seat. It still doesn't matter because the pizza is that amazing. Its BYOB which is always fun and the pizzas and desserts are delicious. Everyone should go here and pay the almost $20 for a pie. Totally WORTH it.
68,5,"This was always one of my favorite bars in downtown Champaign.  The pizza is quite good I think, and had a very unique light crackery crust.  Some of the best thin crust I think I have had.  Bar is nice and roomy, good place to play pool.  The bar could get very crowded on weekends though, nothing aproaching green street bars though.  Nice segueway bar on the transition from ""college"" bar patrion to normal bar patrion.  Sadly many don't make this transition."
69,1,"My boyfriend went this afternoon for the first time. I am Caribbean American and he is African American. From the moment we stepped into the dining room, we felt unwelcomed. No one greeted us, and the waitress was SLOW to arrive (because she was too busy talking and rolling silverware).  When she did arrive, she says ""order- what do you want to order."" No smile or anything. We knew to expect slow service, but she was rude and cold as well.  Although there were only 12 people there, service was absolutely terrible. We came in before the Hispanic family, (european) French family, and interracial family. We ordered before 2 of the three families, but were served last. Served 15 minutes after the last family to arrive, which was almost an hour after we sat down. While my boyfriend and I were wondering where our food was,our waitress sat down with her back facing up and proceeded to eat her own meal.  After watching her eat for about 10 minutes, we got up to leave and another waitress assured us our food was on its way.  We did NOT order complicated meals: shrimp and chicken skewers. So why were we ignored until the food arrived and served last? There were only 2 of us, compared to the non-black families of three and four that were served with kindness before us."
70,5,Great way to spend a night out in Atlanta. Bringing my gf here seems to always do the trick. I do suggest being prepared for the long bathroom and bar lines.
71,3,"I had been waiting for this place to open for what seemed like forever, and then they did... and it still took me a few weeks to get here. But now that I have been (twice!), I think the wait was worth it - though my bank account would probably disagree.

This ain't a place to grab some cheap food and a few PBRs - this is a place you go to impress some company with fancy gastro-pub grub and an extensive beer list with nothing under $6/pint. 

On my first visit, I shared a bunch of apps with my boyfriend, just to try the place out. We shared the small lobster mac and cheese, mussels with truffle chips, and the charcuterie sampler plate. 

The charcuterie plate was lackluster, but I think that was mostly because we overlooked the ""sampler"" part. Mussels with the truffle chips were better, but the lobster mac and cheese was divine! The beers we tried were also really good, and they seem to rotate them often so there's always something new to try with each visit.

Second trip back this weekend, with a friend in town visiting: went for the lobster mac and cheese again because I couldn't stop thinking about how good it was... but this time it was just okay. Kind of sad that the cheese was a bit watery and I crunched down into a piece of shell. The shepard's pie was delicious though, as were the gravy fries we all shared. Our friend ordered the fried oysters, and though I didn't try it, they looked really good.

Overall, I really like this place. It has great service and laid back ambiance. I plan to come back in the future, just not as often as I was hoping - which probably makes my wallet happy."
72,4,"Mmmmm...TAAAAASTY.  Came here with my man (he's Argentinian), and we were quite impressed.  The empanadas were delish, LOVED the chicken and the ham/cheese/cherry tomato/mushroom.  He ordered the Napolitano (chicken) which is a breaded chicken topped with ham and cheese and tomato.  He suggested that I order the entrana with chimichurri (comes with salad) which was TO DIE FOR.  It needed a little dash of salt, which was on the table already, and it was crazy juicy.  CRAZY juicy...juice was all over the place.  I definitely used my napkin for this meal.
I had to write about it because I took some of it home, and ate the rest of it just now (a day and a half later), and even brutalized it in the microwave (I gave it a quick blast just to take the chill off of it), and it STILL held up and was freakin' juicy and delicious.
I sprinkled a little truffle salt and wow.  Just wow.
The waiter was super cool too.  I am looking forward to coming back to try more goods there."
73,3,"So I recently returned to the Border Cafe, and decided to brave the crowds on a weekday night. We ended up waiting for about 20 minutes to sit down on a Wednesday - maybe the wait would be faster during the winter.

I ordered the chicken and beef fajitas - they included a lot of food (in fact, I stuffed myself when I ate the leftovers). The fajitas came with 4 tortillas and a good portion of toppings/roasted peppers. I would say that the food here is solid - not the most authentic mexican, but a fairly decent value and pretty tasty."

77,4,Great sushi I decided to give this place a shot. Mike the manager really makes this place better then good. Sushi was really well priced and the vibe was great.
78,3,I've had various tastes of all the pretty cupcakes and have had inconsistent experiences - some good and some really bad (ie dry and no flavor).  Generally the red velvet seems to be the best in terms of moist consistency compared to others.
79,3,"Charlie's Kitchen is a great dive for late-night beer food, good burgers, and a pretty cool Beer Garden. We stopped in for lunch last weekend, though, and discovered their Achille's heel: the fried chicken. ""chicken"" is on the sign out front, so you'd think there was some sort of attention paid to the dish...

No. It's prefab chicken bits, not-quite-discernable pieces of chicken that are breaded to oblivion and fried up extra crispy. I tried to eat a bit, and.... no. 

Next up: nachos. Any place that serves a ton of beer should master the art of communal snacking food such as nachos, right? Not in this case. Stale tortilla chips scattered with beans and cheese, akin to something that has emerged from my microwave during a stressful week. 

Staff was attentive, as usual; I still like Charlie's for the bar fare, but this lunch was a bust."
80,3,"It's a nice ma-and-pa type of place to eat. It's pretty small but cozy-recommend a seat out on the street. The food is relatively cheap and the service is good enough to make me want to come back again! I would highly recommend the hamburger and fries, only $5.95! I was in a party of 3 and I was the last to get my food, and I jokingly asked what the deal was with my burger and fries. The lady joked back that I had asked for it to be well-done so it takes time. And the next thing I know, the chef hand-delivered my order and tells me that he added a special thousand island sauce and tells me that it will be very good!"
81,5,"Best ice cream in the state! The smell of the waffle cones wafting through the front door and into Atwood Street made for a very difficult decision 20 years ago as a student at Pitt; do I spend my last 5 bucks on a cone or at a keg party? I wish I could say that the cone won out more often but hey, I like beer. So the cone winning at all speaks volumes to the quality of this ice cream!

This is how ice cream should be. Their peach ice cream is the best! It's made from wholesome, honest ingredients...unlike that place in the middle of cow country whose peach ice cream is named after a football coach who only pretended to be wholesome and honest. Boosh!

I just wish they still made the Dave & Andy's Grateful Dead ice cream kid t shirts! Hail to Dave & Andy's! Hail to Pitt!"
82,4,"After my Mom expressed a new-found interest in cupcakes, I decided to surprise her with some for her birthday. Sprinkles has quite the reputation and is right next to my work in Stanford Shopping Center, so I gave them a shot.

The cupcakes did not disappoint. The cake was super moist, definitely better than any cupcake I've had in the past. I can understand how some people may think the frosting is a tad too sweet, but for those with a natural born sweet-tooth (like myself) I thought the sweetness level was about right. My personal favorites are the red velvet and the strawberry cupcakes. Make sure to check which flavors are available for a certain day of the week if you're just going to walk in, however, I believe if you order ahead of time they can do any flavor you please. It's $3.50 for a single cupcake, $39 for a dozen, but they carry containers that can fit any number of cupcakes you wish to carry out. Service was efficient and friendly.

I've seen Cupcake Wars on Food Network quite often, so it was a treat to finally sample the product of Candace Nelson's legacy. Sprinkles will definitely be an option as a gift or special occasion treat."
83,5,"The tastiest turkey burger ever. I got to try this prior to planning my wedding- DELICIOUS. Great people, good food= good times"
84,4,"Best Thai Food on the Ave, enormous missed opportunity with the facilities.

As everyone else says, this is clearly the best Thai food on the Ave, authentic, with lots of spices (and very spicy if you ask for it).  Highly recommend the panang curry with fried tofu, phad thai, and the soups (made fresh!).  Unbeatable price too.

I spoke with the owner and suggested they expand the place, they seemed uninterested.  Quite frankly I don't understand their decision, with the place next door (what used to be The Light Gourmet) changing owners every few months, it seems there are options just nearby.  The chef claimed his mom (who taught him to cook) has a thai restaurant in Bellevue/Kirkland that is bigger and has parking, so I went to check that one out.  I won't get into my experience with that here, but it wasn't nearly as good as Thai Tom (don't waste your time/money trying to find it).

Call in your order and get it to go if you can.  I hope someday they resolve the facilities issues."
85,4,"U District essential.  This cafe is lively and open  - makes it feel great to be out of the office or library.  Definitely study oriented whenever UW is in session so come prepared to share space with people with laptops and big text books.  I'm a little disappointed that the wifi actually works now since that means more computer geeks to contend with. 

Seriously people,stop complaining about the loud music!  When I started coming here years ago it was much louder. Music has always been what give the place its soul. (Bring back the loud techno beats! ) 

If you want somewhere quiet go to the library.

And coffee snob friends  assure me theirs  is among the best"
86,3,"Tarantino's is the kind of place that you either love or hate. They don't do what successful businesses do (e.g. a Web site, or do social media, or even take credit/debit), but it is always packed for dinner. The food is tasty but can be too oily and a bit of a gut bomb. The menu has some very good items, and some not so good, and the service can be nice and other times downright crappy. It's the kind of place to go when you just want to fill your belly with Italian food. Personally, I think it's FAR better than Casa Bianca (which I can't stand), but there are probably just as many people who love that place and hate Tarantino's. 

Portions are pretty large (plus you get a green salad and a slice of garlic pizza bread) so my husband and I usually share a dish and get a plate of those luscious garlic rolls. I'm also a huge fan of the combo salad, which is a plate of 4-5 different salads, including  sliced cucumbers in sour cream, two types of pasta salad, marinated chick peas, and surprisingly tasty slices of sliced of red cabbage.

When I was a meat-eater I would almost always get the Tucci's Special pizza that had a lovely blend of sauteed shrimp, basil, and cheese. There is a ""vegetarian"" pizza on the menu, but BE WARNED:  It contains anchovies, and they're not listed on the menu? WTF, right? When my husband explained this to one of the servers, the bland response was, ""that's how they make it."" (Remember what I said earlier about crappy service?) If this had been any other place we would've left and never come back, but at this point we're regulars and more willing to look past their mistakes.

I say give it a try, and if it's not stellar, give it another try. But don't feel obligated to love the place."
87,5,"Went to Vinny's today for lunch with my co-workers and I have to say, the pepperoni pizza was sooo yummy! To make it even better, I had a scoutmob deal for a FREE slice so it was a win-win today! Will def be back soon!"
88,4,"I'm getting kind of comfortable with this place. Easing into things. Building a bit of a rapport. It certainly took me a while to make a move. I don't know what Tibetan food is, so how do I know if I'm in the mood for it? I guess sometimes you just need to go for it. I went for it. Again and again. Might even go for it again tonight.

As it turns out, Tibetan food is good. THE END. Just kidding. And anyway I'm no expert. I don't even know the names of the things I eat here. Chicken in chili sauce? Excellent. Some kind of beef stew with noodles and mushrooms and potatoes? Very niiiice. Shrimp and tofu in a curry sauce? Why not? ""Fried bread"" filled with mushrooms and pureed chick peas? OH HEY THANKS. And it looks like giant balls! There is a pretty wide variety of tastes in the dishes, so it doesn't get boring.

It's comfort food. But it's not super heavy or oily. Bonus.

A note: if they tell you something is spicy, they are lying. 

(but i love them anyway)"
89,4,"I found this place after a date with my now girlfriend Sarah more than a year ago.  Hungarian pastries are something I grew up with, and my Mom, now in her 70s, has not baked any in at least 10 years. I thought I would suprise her with a couple of treats, and I have been back at least monthly ever since.

I have never eaten inside, only take out, so I can'r comment on service and beverages.  There are always plenty of Columbia and other students there in the evenings, sipping coffee, talking and eating their pastry.  They seem very content if that means anything.  

While all the pastries look delicious, I have only tried three of them; Rigo Jancsi, Dobos Torte and Apple Struddle.  Both the Dobos Torte and Apple Struddle were truly good and reminded me of my mother's versions.  However, the Rigo Jancsi is my favorite. It is so rich and chocolatey that you have to share a slice otherwise you go into chocolate overload. Pure heaven is how my Mom calls it.. and having a brother that was a pastry chef back in the old country, I think she knows her stuff.   I just brought some pastries to her last weekend; much to her delight.

Yes, I am a fan of this quaint little coffee and pastry house and hope to stay a bit next time and sample their coffee, nosh on a pastry and read my Kindle. It seems like a nice place to do so."
90,4,"Came here today for lunch and fell in love with this cute restaurant shop. Since I came pretty late, I ordered lunch food, a salad. However, this place is more known for their brunch food - crepes, pancakes, waffles, and they have amazingly cute pastries. The salad was pretty huge. I was defiinitely full. My friend ordered the strawberry gelato, which is also pretty amazing. I have to admit that their food is on the pricier side, especially for college students since my salad came out to be about $12, but it's definitely a neat place to visit. 

Next time, I definitely want to check out their desserts and brunch food."
91,2,"I will give a disclaimer that all of my experiences are based off of delivery, but I just don't see what all of the hype is about. The food is eh... I personally think that Manischewitz mix makes better matzoh ball soup. I've gotten both salads and sandwiches and they've been ok, but quite expensive and soggy or cold when I've finally had the food in my hands."
92,3,"It's up above 3 bucks now huh? Has been going up a quarter every year. Now, I haven't been here in a long time, what with trying to eat healthier and this being the antithesis of healthy... but I sure went a ton in my first 2 years of school at Columbia, and I'm sure it's the same as then.

1) One slice is a good meal. It is BIG and it is filling. And pretty tasty.
2) Don't get anything other than cheese unless you're crazy. Sprinkle some red pepper or oregano or pamesan or garlic powder. Screw the other toppings
3) It's kind of greasy, but not in an excessively bad way.
4) Fold it. Mmmm...

Yeah, it is perfect for a greasy late night snack, better had less sober than not, and better the colder the weather is.

That being said, it is not the best pizza in the world (though after writing this review I am craving a slice)... but for the area, it's hard to do better."
93,5,"What a beautiful little oasis in Palo Alto! Stopped by for a happy hour and was delighted to see that this Sheraton has an outdoor pool area. It's a little retro, too, which I love! 

Although I was dressed in street clothes, I would not hesitate to come back in my swimsuit and bask in the sun. Wondering if they'd notice if I snuck in on a quiet weekday afternoon...?"
94,5,"Best Philly Cheese Steak in LA and superb/friendly customer service!!! Besides the cheese steak sandwiches, the fried potato chips are very good!  We could not stop eating..."
95,5,"One of my favorite places to eat on the ave.  Definitely the best Thai place. They have a pretty large menu (with pictures!) and I have yet to get anything that I didn't like. The servers are very nice.  

It's a bit hard to find - it's in a basement and you have to follow some signs to get to it."
96,5,They just melt in your mouth and they are super cheap under $2.00 :) only bummer is there's a line all the time but that's cause there delicious!!!
97,2,"The pastry shop looked really yummy, but I only ordered one item because I had no idea what the other things were, and was afraid i would hold up the line. So i just ordered what i knew- strawberry!

There is normally a misconception about the word ""strawberry shortcake"" and most of the time they mean strawberry chiffon cake, given that it is really soft and fluffy. But here they really had shortcake. It was TOOOO sweet. The cream was so buttery and made me feel so icky. The shortcake was hard and didn't seem to go well with the strawberry cream."
98,5,"Best undergraduate college in the capital region. Small classes and campus. Great teachers and a wonderful atmosphere. Everyone is friendly and there is so much to do on campus. Great school for all sorts of majors with helpful staff. Many opportunities as well! 

Class of 2011!!"
99,2,"I ordered the ""black and blue"" burger medium.  The meat came back well done and dry.  Barely any blue cheese or bbq sauce on the bun, so overall was a terrible meal."
100,4,I attended a wedding at the chapel.  Nice space.
101,4,"I waited for 30 minutes but I will wait another 30 if I had to. 

Had the pizza with shrimp, anchovies, olives and capers. I love anchovies. Don't even argue with me on this. 

This place is an assembly line of deliciousness. You can order whatever kind of pizza you want. Their toppings are unbelievable- from prosciutto to shrimp to celebrated cheeses, possibilities are just endless. 

Yes, you wait but I would wait for good food than have bad food fast."
102,4,"Worth attending for a well-made, tasty and healthy brunch. Tip is to share the dishes with some sides as they are relatively large servings. Great place to stop by for food. If I could it would be 3.5 stars though because the service is only ok, as is the ambiance."
103,3,"Superb ingredients.  Excellent technique.  But in the end, and for the price point, nothing special.  Mostly all kind of bland.  Maybe they are going for subtle and delicate.  I dunno.  For $130+ per person with wine, completely  not at all worth it.

I tried the squid noodle (best savory item I had, but as the amuse it was teeny), sashimi (boring but fresh) , pig tail (very nice), pork 3 ways (salty), the sausage stuffed chicken (bland), and the haddock (was ok).

The best thing I had all night  was the apricot-almond torte.

Also, THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE WORKING THERE.  I have never seen anything like it.  There were never fewer than 5 of them crowding around our table chatting.  Sometimes 8 or 9.  It felt freaky and circusy."
104,2,"I didn't think it would be so difficult to get an iced double espresso.

I had my own travelers mug (because I want to avoid wasting cups) in which I wanted to get an iced double espresso. Yes, I understand that some cheapskates would ask for an iced double espresso in a large cup and fill it up with cold milk from the condiment bar to make a ""ghetto latte"". Which is why I specifically asked for my mug to be completely filled with ice so that there wouldn't be room for a lot of milk (or soy milk in my case). I only wanted a tiny bit of soy milk anyway.

And still, I was given a hard time about it and told that I would have to be charged extra for a latte. They handed me the double espresso in a paper cup (which was then wasted) with a tiny bit of ice (which was pretty much melted) and gave me back my travelers mug empty.

(At which point, what would have stopped me from pouring the cold espresso into my mug and filling it up with milk anyway?)

Fine. If you don't trust me to not fill my cup up with milk/soy milk, you can offer to put a little bit of soy milk into my cup for me ... or something. 

I have never had problems getting iced double espressos anywhere else. I won't be coming back here, which won't be a terrible loss since a) the coffee and food is a little overpriced, and b) the line is SO UNNECESSARILY SLOW that even though I arrived 20 minutes before class, I was still late for class just across the street at TC."
105,4,"I've been here a few times now and enjoyed it every time. It's a particularly type of bar-- no table service, quieter atmosphere-- but a type I tend to like.

I'm not actually a big beer drinker, which sometimes puts a damper on going out. What's nice about Big Time is that (at least every time I've gone there), they've had a really nice cider on tap. They've been complex, dry, sweet, whatever, but always interesting and always tasty. It means I can still grab a pint with the rest of them.

I also tend to want to munch on something while drinking. Big Time, as long as you get there early enough, has a little kitchen that makes snack-esque-type food. They do nachos right.

If you're looking for a good drink with a little less college craziness, go here."
106,1,"I ordered the lunch special Chicken Tikka Massala and was quite disappointed. The chicken was very dry, and the sauce was bland.  The veggies that came with the plate actually had flavor and weren't that bad. I would've traded in half of my enormous mound of rice for maybe one more little piece of chicken, the plate only came w/ three pieces. Definitely not coming back."
107,4,"The Penn Bookstore (short for University of Pennsylvania Bookstore) is right next to the Inn at Penn Hotel - and has a back door into the book store right outside the front door of the hotel.

I stopped in here after dinner to grab some reading material for evening entertainment - having forgot to bring a book. Very nice and extensive selection of books, magazines, even office supplies. There is also a coffee shop upstairs which serves Starbucks coffee and espresso drinks."
108,4,Good both times I've been there.  Great burgers.  CHEAP food which is not easy to find in such a bustling area.  Some people have mentioned the service but ours was great at the beer garden bar.  Great spot out back there too.  Good beer selection.  I will go back again.
109,3,"Haven't actually been upstairs, but ordered Long Island from the bar and had them bring it down to Sun Hong Kong. From what I tasted, it was actually quite tasty. I don't know if that means that there was more coke than alchy, but I downed it, and I was pretty good. GJ Kips."
110,1,"I went here for a happy hour during a weekday.  

The only things I can remember out of this experience were cons:
-too LOUD.  I could not even hear the person across from me
-pretty expensive since tapas only come with a few pieces...and you need a few orders to get you full
-parking sucks! but that goes for most rice village restaurants/stores/bars

The food...nothing special for me to remember.  

I left with the thought that I don't plan to really come back."
111,5,Malibu Yogurt is great. It is the same Malibu Yogurt. Nothing has changed  just the location.  The yogurt tastes like ice cream.  The people are nice.  I like going over there and having a small bite of yogurt and in Malibu.
112,4,"After a weekend reunion/bachelor party with a bunch of old friends, alot of whom like me spent alot of hours of youth in harvard square.  While reminiscing of drugs, fights, and general tomfoolery the tastey came up in conversation.  What I never realized was that leo's bought alot of the stools and counter tops as well as menu's from the now gone tasty.  I have been to leo's over the years but never thought about it till this weekend.  I went in yesterday for breakfast and am now reminded, but they do got a pretty cheap and decent sausage egg and cheese and I think I may head in there in a few minutes cause fuck work again!!!"
113,4,"You know what, The AOW is a pretty darn good gym. There is a good stack of towels waiting you. The machines are usually line free. And the weight lifting equipment barely has a line either. Also the wet-towel dispensers are usually stocked and most of the patrons partake in cleaning up the machiens they just finished using. All of the equipment is in pretty good shape and fix up time is about one week from what I witnessed on the elliptical machines. There is even a punching bag in the exercise room. All in all for the low price, this is a good gym. Now if only they could install a proper swimming pool somewhere..."
114,1,"I like the food at this place, but they REALLY need to get their customer service together. The husband and I went for lunch 3 weeks ago. We didn't order anything fancy or complicated, yet we watched 4 other tables that were seated after us get food first. Our appetizers and our main dish came out at the same time, and my husband had to ask for his chai repeatedly beofre they remembered it. I chalked it up to them being busy. These things happen. Fast forward to last night, I had friends over to visit me because I'm recovering from an illness, and we all thought it would be nice to order Indian food and watch some movies. I called them at 9:30, ready to place a HUGE order, and was told they weren't delivering. The restaurant closes at 11. I figured 9:30 was early enough.  We were all super disappointed. My friends wound up leaving to go to the International District for Chinese. At this point, I'm pretty sure I'm not going to give Garam Masala another chance to upset me."
115,3,"The food isn't bad compared to most Chinese food in Blacksburg, but you'll frequently find your dish doused in some sticky sauce. The flavors are frequently way too loud, for example the onions in the Mongolian Pork overpower everything else in the dish."
116,5,"I had a set of Phil Woods laced up to Velocities (The wheels were done exactly when they said they would be and they even put on the new tires and tubes for me. I'm getting lazy in my old age), a Chris King head set put on and a  new bottom bracket. The head set and the bottom bracket they had ready the next day and I dropped the bike off at closing time the night before. The guys and gals over there did an excellent job. The wheels are still perfectly true and nothing else has had any problems. My girl got an old Triumph 3 speed there at a good price and the thing will never die. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that is looking to buy track components or an affordable/reliable city style bike. They do also have some super duper nice stuff over there too if you are looking to spend or up grade."
117,5,"My favorite place for a burger!  I always hit UBurger up before any Sox games I happen to go to.  Big Papi always bats 1.000 in here.  If not, I go for the hot chick.  

If I am there with my other hot chick, we split an order of fries, and she gets a chocolate frap.  When she is not looking, I usually steal a sip of that frap, and I'd say they are pretty good.  

I have not yet gotten the onion rings here, but that's near the top of my bucket list.  

They have a big TV, usually with sports on, so that's nice.  Especially, say, if you're going to a sox game but running late but still must to go to Uburger first.  

My only question for Uburger is why do we only get a small opening to throw our trash into?  I usually spend 5 minutes throwing away my stuff, though--in all fairness-- it is kind of like a puzzle, which can be fun sometimes.  Unless it's the 3rd inning already...."
118,3,"Great place for subs while running between classes! Although, there's always a long line right around lunch-time, so get there early or plan on getting a late lunch."
119,5,"I loved this place! It's definitely my new favorite. 

I ordered a Lychee Icee Bubble Tea with Tapioca. It was delicious and not overwhelmingly sweet. It was quiet (on a Thursday afternoon) and there weren't a lot of people. I had to wait a bit to get my beverage, but it was worth it. The service was great, the decor was new and fun, and there was a large selection of reasonably-priced beverages. 

They have a TV inside playing and the seating is comfortable. If you're around the area, I'd definitely consider dropping by. I'll be coming back soon!"
120,1,"would not recommend. he gave no personalization to my case never made me feel like i was even important, and actually misdiagnosed me. when i told him i thought differently he said i was wrong. well after doing extensive research and checking with other doctors, HE WAS WRONG. this guy wasted my time and money. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."
121,5,"I bypassed Pete's to come here (because I like to explore new places), and thank God I did!  The coffee is outstanding and it's a great place to sit and work.  Definitely the place to go for coffee in Westwood!"
122,5,"This is a pretty fabulous bagel shop, although what previous reviewers have said is true, they do a lot more than just bagels!  I just haven't tried anything else- I just want a bagel from a bagel place, and this is the place to get a good one.  Love their specialty cream cheese, especially the veggie.  Their coffee is always hot and fresh as well and you make it yourself, which is always a plus in my book.  The employees are friendly, although more friendly after 9am I'd say (the early morning crew are about as happy as I am before my coffee).  Overall, I would say this is a great place to start your day.  Recommended!"
123,3,"Welcome to IHOP, please leave your expectations in the doorway. IHOP is one of the only establishment open 24 hrs on the main part of campus, and you know what? It sounds pretty good around 2am once the bars have closed. I would only give this place a chance with a little liquid courage, and that's ok. If you're looking for a family dining experience you are much better off at the Original Pancake House on Springfield--but IHOP certainly has its place."
124,3,"Didn't know what to expect from this restaurant - except that I had heard good things.  Didn't know what to get, so the guy at the counter suggested the Bipimbap with beef bulgogi.  I thought the meat was pretty fatty (meaning lack of meat) and a lot of the rice was burned onto the bottom of the serving pan.  All in all, it could have been better tasting and it seemed the ingredients were fresh and it was presented well...but we left hungry and dissatisfied.  Not what you want from dinner, no?

2.5 stars."
125,2,"I don't usually shop here because it's a little expensive for some run down looking clothes I can find at goodwill. This place is usually messy when I walk in. 

My favorite place in the store is in the sale and clearance section. You'll find good deals but you have to literally dig in the piles and racks of clothes.

The small weird trinkets they carry always amuse me but not worth a constant visit.

I'm not sure what to think of this store sometimes..."
126,4,I've always had a good time at Fish Co.  Once you're out of college though you'll feel a little bit out of place--if you're in college check it out though--great drink specials and nice atmosphere when the weather's nice.
127,4,Apples... good...
128,5,"Sure, your delivery boys stink when they arrive after trekking across the village on the hotter days. And sometimes, they even stink on some of the cooler days. It's OK because they made that trip for me and they are always super nice. 

I've had this love affair with Sockos for about 2 years and I'd like to layout the reasons why.

1. The fastest delivery service in Westwood. They usually clock in under 30 minutes.

2. Fresh bread and fresh ingredients with super yummy dressings.

3. They will grab and deliver you a cookie from next door at:

http://www.yelp.com/biz/diddy-riese-cookies-los-angeles#hrid:1R3LiESiY4fanlRzhBhgAA/src:search/query:cookies

4. AND... SOCKOS IS SUPER CHEAP!!! Usually, 10 bucks or less with tip.

Pretty awesome place!"
129,5,"Absolutely wonderful meal for daughter's birthday!  Beautifully prepared, creative ingredients, so fresh and tasty and staff was attentive and kind. Grandparents and adult kids and grand children - all had a really great meal. I had the Cinderella sushi and it was spectacular and the sushi with the tempura soft shell crab was extra special. Fabulous technique and sooo good!"
130,4,I stumbled across this bar one late night.  The atmosphere is great and the food is event better. I wanted to try everything on the menu. The crab and shrimp nachos are delicious. And its open late
131,5,"Don't miss this great little jewelry store! Just come here prepared to open your wallet... There is no such thing as ""just browsing."" You WILL find something you want to buy.

Zinnia has fashion-forward jewelry that is jaw-droppingly affordable: distinctive, eye-catching necklaces for $5 to $20. Make sure you have a few minutes when you come in--give yourself time to ooh and ahh over all the candy-colored baubles. Some of it is a bit artistically edgy, too. They keep up with the trends (e.g., the recent feather earring craze). You can get something here for your wild night with the girls or your next job interview/that big PowerPoint presentation.

This place really makes me question why other jewelry stores cost so much. It's Claire's Boutiques prices with about 1,000x the quality. Most of their stock is costume jewelry, but they also carry slightly higher-end items, too (sterling silver, 14K gold) and these items are very high quality and good price for what you're getting."
132,5,"How have I not heard of this place! Oh right, it is in Bruinland and I usually breakout in hives when I'm in that area, being that I'm a Trojan. 

Fortunately for me, Diddy not only satisfied my post drinking craving for sugar, it also prevented my hives*! 

Two cookies and ice cream in the middle for $1.50. What's the catch? Are they big as quarters? Are the cookies old? Do I have to sell my soul in the process? 

None of the above, the cookies were fresh and huge. The ice cream also hit the spot. I went with peanut butter and white chocolate cookie with cookie dough ice cream. Amazing! I may even try to sneak into enemy territory again, high risk, high reward. 

*Results may vary, Trojans should go into the area at their own risk"
133,4,"I wasn't expecting much from Legal considering their multiple locations, but everyone insisted its the best place to go for seafood in Boston. Solid seafood menu and great raw bar selection. I loved their chowder."
134,4,"This place is great! I love good, fresh fish, and this place is great for the $$. The chefs are nice, and while you won't find anything too gourmet or out of the ordinary, the quality is good and the price isn't too bad. I didn't try any of the rolls, but I agree with the other posting that the oysters are fantastic! I also had two orders of the Uni because it was so fresh.

The only annoying thing was the other customers near me; they seem to be fanatical regulars, but were pretty obnoxious. Hope you don't encounter them!"
135,3,"Went here with some friends - a fun place for Ethiopian food and pretty quick, decent service although lacking in Ethiopian smiles and sunshine.

None of the food was bursting with freshness or originality, a common theme  with Ethiopian food outside of DC, making this place fade away into the realm of average. The injera (bread) was quite good - a pleasant suprise

Doro Wat (chicken) - solid offering; right amount of spiciness
Gored Gored (raw meat) - also pretty good, a little too buttery but that's how the ethiopians like it. nice spice again.
Tibs (grilled lamb) - fine but not memorable
Gomen (collared greens) - a little soggy and flavorless, but an important counterweight to all the meat
Shiro (split peas) - not very fresh, not very tasty, looked like mud
Messir (lentils) - a bit better than the shiro but not by much. too spicy.
Vegetable beyayenetu (veggie combo) - excluding the above three, it wasn't bad, but they constituted 3/5

Overall I would come back if I happened to be in the area and was with friends who were in the mood. Recommend the meat dishes over the veggie ones, which is sad because usually it would be the opposite.

Ambiance was a bit blah despite what other reviewers have said. Nice selection of Ethiopian beers and the sparkling water - Ambo."
136,3,"i loved this place! burgers and fries at a great price! =) fries are crispy and thin, just the way i like it.
 
minus stars b/c i've had better burgers.

ultimately, i really liked the fact that i could actually eat a burger like a burger.. meaning i can hold it up and actually bite into it. :D it was nice."
137,4,"MMM seasonal pumpkin mmm. 

Only tried it once.  Man that stuff is soo good :]."
138,4,"I had been putting off trying hot yoga for months, even after many prods from a faithful friend, but ended up going one day about a month ago.  It was cold outside, but lovely inside - points for hot yoga!

Though I can't imagine going in the summer, for a Boston winter it is really refreshing and invigorating.  The instructor I had was great - sensitive to the fact that I was a first-timer, but also able to keep the class at a level that was appropriate and challenging for everyone.  I left wanting to go back, but paying by the class isn't exactly my style, so we'll have to see.  If you become a regular, you can sit at the front desk before classes and check people in, and then attend class for free.  Great idea!"
139,4,"I've been here more times than I can count. It's a really cool place. And happy hour is awesome.

If you go on Sundays they have a 3 course prime rib special. Salad, Prime Rib and dessert for $35, you can't really go wrong with that, right? Really good. They have seasonal prefixe menus too if you're into that. 

All in all the food here is pretty good. Definitely get the Flemming's potatoes. They're basically scalloped potatoes that they put orgasms into. It's THAT good. The waiters are SUPER helpful and attentive. If you have any questions when it comes to the menu, they will certainly have an answer for you. And if you have any special request for how your dinner is prepared, they will absolutely make sure it is to your liking, or they will have it fixed until it IS to your liking. 

The happy hour has definitely improved recently. They have a ""5 for $6 till 7"" thing where it's 5 different wines, 5 different cocktails and 5 different menu items for $6 till 7pm. Very good. I really like the calamari during happy hour. Tell them to go easy on the sauce though, it could be a little over powering.

I'll definitely be coming back for both happy hour and dinner. Yums!"
140,2,"As an MIT student, this is the nearest place to get bubble tea in Boston. The staff are always super friendly and have great recommendations. Their fusions rolls are also AMAZING, but at $15, slightly overpriced (especially for an addicted college student like myself). I usually come and grab a bubble tea during the day, but beware - if you come in the evening or at night, they have limited flavours. Also, I have attempted ordering a Green Apple blended ice for the past four months, and they never seem to have green apple flavouring...

EDIT: As of May 2011 or so, Leisure Station no longer serves fusion rolls. Well, there goes my reason for actually going to this place.."
141,4,"Not bad at all! I still prefer to go to Pho Vietnam, but if that place was closed for some reason I would most definitely come here.  Their broth is good, could use a little more greens or spices in the broth.  The seating is undoubtedly the most comfortable out of all of the pho places, and it seems the most clean."
142,4,"I recently have had to do a variety of catering orders from Crema for work. Not only were they easy to work on the phone, they were very flexible in terms of delivery. They also were able to get me two extra box of joe's in short notice.

Everyone loved the food at the meetings and I'll definitely be ordering from them more often for work."
143,4,"Great friendly service and some sleepers (shoes) can be found in this hipster boutique.

For my four years at Cal, I've been shopping at Bows and Arrows for the go to spot for trendy, modern footgear. Not to mention, I'm a shoe head and I manage to find dope kicks at this venue.

Furthermore, I just found out that this store now has a Jordan account meaning they sell Js. I bought the Olympic 6s, Uptempo air and barkleys here. This compelled me to write an even more positive review! Good stuff fellas! Keep up the good work.

Will be using this store as my destination for Js and my ever growing show collection."
144,1,"When I lived upstairs in the International House and missed a meal at the cafeteria, I twice made the mistake of eating here rather than going out.  Both meals I had tasted as if they were leftovers that had been sitting in the freezer and simply thrown into the oven or microwave when I ordered.
Also, they have Italian sodas and coffee and such, but I never bothered getting any."
145,4,"We went to check out Zen on Ten a few weeks ago after Josh was recommended there by a client. The restaurant was pretty empty, and there was a guy playing guitar and singing which was cool but a bit loud in such an empty dining room. Our service was fairly quick and our server wasn't annoying or anything.

We decided to split a sampling of different things, so we got miso soup, a salad, a dragon roll and an order of chicken pad thai. All of the food was pretty good (especially the dragon roll,) however the portion of pad thai was really small for how much it cost. We also started off with two of their double espresso martinis which were good but also kind of small and weak for $9 each. 

I will say I was very impressed with the owner. He is one of the only reasons this place gets 4 stars. He came to our table to check on us, told us about himself and how he started the restaurant and was generally just very friendly and made us really feel like he cared. He talked me into trying one of their $10 fishbowl drinks and it was GREAT! Im usually weary of specials like this, but I gotta say I was pleasantly surprised. A huge drink that was just the right level of strength and tasted delicious. 

Generally I enjoyed my time here, but I did feel it was pretty expensive for what we got. Next time I will skip the overpriced martinis and go straight for that fishbowl again!"
146,3,"Stopped by for a quick lunch with friends a few months back, in the sweltering heat of summer. Unfortunately, it didn't feel like they had any air-conditioning in the shop at all! That aside, I ordered a lemonade and it hit the spot. It was fabulous, cold, and definitely tasted homemade and freshly-squeezed.
The sandwich that I ordered was disappointing, however. The appearance of my chicken pesto sammie was a little off-putting: it looked slapped together and the meat had been precooked and was just reheated. My friend ordered a salad with chicken, and I remember her not finishing her dish. I wouldn't go out of my way to have lunch there again, but I would definitely go back to try other drinks on the menu."
147,5,I love this campus and attending grad school here!  Woot!
148,4,Food was fresh and tasted good. Ingredients tasted of above average quality compared to some other middle-of-the-road places. The line is a bit long but that's too be expected since they just opened
149,2,"I dropped off three items, and I specifically asked what the price would be so that I could make sure to have cash (they take Visa; I just try to use cash for small purchases at small businesses).  The woman told me it would be $3 each... total $9, right?  

Wrong.  I came back three days later and the total was $11.50.  I asked what happened, and the same woman said ""I never said that.""  Now, the $2.50 isn't that big of a deal, but it is in principle.  I will not return, although they did a normal dry-cleaning job on the items."
150,5,"Once in a great while not getting what you want turns out to be a good thing. Headed to the newly monikered Border Grill downtown, they were closed for a private party which threw our plans into limbo. I've been having cravings from memories of Mo-Chica so off we went to the Mercado la Paloma. The ambience here is fantastic, on many days you can watch the never ending parade of people who can't figure out how to make an appointment for the DMV on the internet , stand in a line longer than screaming schoolgirls for the latest one-hit-wonder boy band. Okay, the ambience looks more like a few places that didn't make the cut at Olvero Street, but it doesn't matter because inside are some of the most wonderful food stalls you can imagine. 

The restaurants here aren't exactly your typical sit down, napkin in the lap style, they're exactly like the food court at any major shopping mall, except with much better food. On a whim and some great Yelp reviews, we decided to try Chichen Itza instead of Mo-Chica and what a joy it turned out to be. I'm not a fan of sweeping proclamations about something being the best ever, but this is as good Mexican food I have had (at least until the next great discovery).

While this is Mexican food, the plates are far from the typical tacos and enchiladas the masses are familiar with, and instead based from the Yucatan area. And what wonders they are. There's a panucho, simply avocado, onion, lettuce and chicken on a crispy tortilla, but oh so much more.  There's a delightful Cochinita Pibil, one of the signature dishes that's as lovely to look at as it is to taste. On this day, the piece de resistance was a special Queso Relleno that may or may not be a regular menu item but it really should be because it's a stunner. A love of cheese is a necessity to love this plate, but then what would you be eating latin food if you didn't? 

Each dish looks amazing, a little artwork framed by a plate, and at least on this day each one tasted as good as it looked. The uniformly high marks are well deserved here. While we didn't have room for dessert, we had a great Platano con crema, there are some delicious candies, not to mention a really cool banana flavored soda and fruit drinks.

Prices are fantastic, especially considering the quality and flavors. The owners and staff are delightful and welcoming, you really can't ask for anything more. So a big thanks to whoever booked Border Grill for the day, we couldn't be more pleased to have not been invited.

Best Plates: Panucho, Cochinita Pibil, Queso Relleno, Platano con Crema, Guanabana drinks, Cristal Negra Yucateca Soda

Didnt have the 911 style this past time. The thermonuclear seemed a little less hot than i remember though. So, I guess next time, I'll have to go with the 911.
The variety of style is always a win at cluck-U. The wings are always pretty awesome. Maybe not the best in the world, but still good stuff.

Much cleaner than it used to be. All renovated. TVs and all."
152,3,cute coffee shop.  i just hate how busy it can get!  gah....
153,5,"I stayed for the weekend for a staycation to celebrate my birthday and it was amazing. It's like a big hacienda, like you are at someone's home. all the foliage is gorgeous and all the flowers smell great. the staff are so friendly it's almost like ok you can stop now, they really engage in conversation. very relaxing stay."
154,4,"Not sure what it is, but I've had much better customer service experiences at the Powelton location recently.  Nice!"
155,3,"We stayed here free on points since it was convenient to activities we had planned (dinner at the fantastic Kindle Cafe, meandering around New Hope, Lambertville, Princeton, visiting friends, etc.) and had no quibbles, especially since we got in very late, and the staff was nice about it.  

What is Forrestal Village, you ask?  It is a dramatic name evoking frolicking woodland creatures for a fake-Main-Street kind of shopping and business area in which the hotel sits.  If you are with someone who has business obligations and are looking for something to do, there is at least somewhere to walk around, though downtown Princeton is not too far away and so much better.  The ""Village"" is otherwise kind of isolated.  Too bad that *actual* homey mixed-use urban environments are mostly a thing of the past.

The dual shower head gets a mention here a lot.  Why waste twice the amount of water?  I guess it appeals to the easy-to-impress.  Of course there is a beautiful lobby, with Arts and Crafts-inspired design.  We didn't try relaxing in the lobby, something I love to do to get the feel of a hotel, or visit any restaurants.  The coffee maker came with nice strong Starbucks coffee and a cup to take it along. (Note to self: bring reusable cup next time.)  Easily impressed myself, I liked the leaf-shaped soaps.  And I appreciate the kind of bathroom where the shower is in one room and the sink outside of it, so two people can get ready at once.

We liked the huge comfortable beds and large windows, and everything was very clean.  We could see the mostly frozen outdoor pool from our window and later looked in on the indoor pool area which was well done.  

Since I love hotel paper, I am always disappointed to find none in the room (though I scored some sticky notes), but an appeal to the kind desk staff the next morning was fruitful.  (It must not be a request they get often, judging by the reactions.)  

Tall sparkling thingies of ice water and lemon slices sit in the lobby to refresh you, and there is a fruit/snack/coffee bar open in the morning that seemed intermittently staffed.  Didn't matter, because I had my coffee from the room.  There is decent tea-bag-tea too, but hot water from a coffee maker for tea doesn't cut it, I am told."
156,5,Great food and service! I go to Panini Cafe once a week for lunch and they have great food and service. The lunch specials are well priced and delicious.
157,5,"This is undoubtedly the best restaurant in Boston. We've been there twice already, and left completely in awe. The food is impeccable. I cannot point out any dish in particular, but they were all amazing. Tastes are complex, and at the same time, perfectly balanced, as  every ingredient in the dish is can be tasted.  I love the fact that they have the half portion option, because it enables diners to try more of the wonderful dishes offered. Each time, we ordered 8 out of the ten or so dishes offered, and none disappointed. The wine list is impressive as well, and the waiter (we had the same french guy (sorry i don't know your name if you're reading this) both times) was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. The service was very satisfactory and we were treated in a very inviting way by every member of the staff that we interacted with. 

Reservations are needed a long time in advance, especially for the weekends. 

Highly recommended!!!!!!!"
158,4,"Great pizza! Blows blondies out of the water(and I like Blondies too) The price is right and the za' is str8 grubbin. The stoners probably love this place, but I dont have to be high to crave some fat slice......get it everytime i'm in Berk"
159,5,"I love this shop. :)

Disclaimer: I own Hub Comics, in Union Square, Somerville.

MYP is one of the shops that inspired me to open my place. Their product selection is unparalleled, and they have an amazing local/zine/adult section that they have accumulated over the past 30 years.

The owner is a great guy, as well, and he generally has helpful people working there. The only down side of the place is its size. 

The location and selection are both excellent. I just wish he could have, say, the old Wordsworth book store space instead. :)

And, Tony, if you're reading this, I'll take any backstock of your zine/local stuff that you want to sell cheap. I want to have as much as possible at my shop, and that stuff is much more ephemeral than any of the other stuff we sell. 

Also -- re: wheelchair accessibility. I see 5 ""no"" votes. I almost voted no, but I remember that there's an elevator. The shop itself may be a little tight in the aisles for a wheelchair in spots, but you could definitely get in."
160,2,"The sandwiches are terrific -- but definitely small (unless you sport around 9-10 bucks for the full).  Really flavorful and creative.  

But this is a campus of busy folks, and Ike's is so slow and full of attitude that it's not worth it.

Seriously?  45 minutes for a sandwich?  I say this after multiple visits, and others have noted the same in reviews.  Do not go here during the lunch hour unless you want to eat a bag of chips and wait almost an hour for your next course (which will be delicious, but tinged with frustration).

Also, the staff are not very friendly.  We waited so long that we had to ask for our sandwiches to be put in a bag to go.  This simple task took another ten minutes to accomplish.  Outrageous.  And not even a hint of apology."
161,4,"After having eaten authentic Korean food, it's hard to find something that makes an impression on you in the states. I didn't walk in with high expectations (despite the fact I made sure to read reviews, which were all high), so I left pretty pleased. 

I think Tofu House gets it pretty close to real Korean cuisine. I feel like I've had much better side dishes in my life, but the bulgogi was DELISH. I haven't had a good bulgogi in a while! I spent almost over two hours in conversation with a friend and the waitress/hostess made sure that we had plenty of water and were satisfied; great service. 

Only thing that could really be worked on is the appearance of the establishment. It was a bit shabby, and they could definitely embrace the whole dark and basic look with a few touches here and there!

Overall, I am very pleased with my experience with Korean food on the AVE (I didn't think that'd be possible!), and will probably come back."
162,1,"Ah! Stay away.  This is a dishonest business where the OWNER will tell you that ""you don't have to worry about gas"" and then charge you at the end of the day and deny he ever said that. It doesn't say it on the contract but doesn't matter.  I was told that ""well, I have your credit card number right here, so I can charge you no matter what"".  WOW.  I have never been so disrespected and treated so unprofessionally by a business before.  I can't believe Massvacation recommended this place.  There are plenty of other marinas along the Connecticut River.  A quick search showed alternatives like:

Normally I do not like writing a bad review, but I feel totally justified here.  Not only did the large group that I was with feel the same way, but I was also justified in the parking lot by another customer.  He said that other places don't charge for gas and he totally agreed that the guy was sneaky about the gas charge."
163,2,"The traditional burger here sucks balls. It is expensive for the size, salty as fuck, and tastes no healthier than any other beef patty sandwiched by mediocre buns. You can find a better burger practically anywhere someone knows how to cook. Their tasteless advertising also makes my ass muscles clench. 

I added an extra star for the vegetarians who seem to be satisfied by their menu choices. Then again, there's no way to really make chloroplast unhealthy and anger-inducing."
164,1,This business closed more than two years ago.
165,4,"great, cheap, and right by campus - my friend and I split  lamb and chicken rolls that were divine + the chips - a small order was enough for the two of us. we came for lunch but I guess it would be while inebriated as well..? either way, it's nice quick food that doesn't leave you feeling ill later when sitting through some long-winded lecture about important stuff and whatnot. also seriously...the chips! the best!"
166,1,"I'M GONNA SAY NO.
It's unfortunate that I write with this tone, because I feel as though I wasn't able to give Kai's the right review when it was in it's ""prime"". When the restaurant first opened, one of the co-owners was a good friend. I had not made it into the restaurant however, until after the management had changed hands. I went in with a friend after work, to be greeted (or not), by an unfriendly waitress who took quite a long while before she offered us a happy hour menu. After impatiently standing by our sides while waiting for us to order, she returned with our two rather stiff drinks. I do enjoy a stiff drink, but I prefer to have them with a good snack or meal. Unfortunately the gyoza was drenched in an abnormally large amount of oil, and the rest of the dishes were not memorable..so I'm not convinced that that speaks well of them. Regardless, I don't think that I'll be returning here anytime in the near future. I may at some point, to give it another chance, but I would rather support a restaurant like Flowers or Ruby's up the street."
167,5,"I've been coming here since they opened. I can't say enough good things about this place. 

The sardine sandwich is the best sardines you will ever eat. (I know that's a low bar to top.)

On that ""Lex's Favorite"", careful of the runny egg. It was comedy the first time, tragedy the next. 

OBLT and Meatloaf sandwich also worthy of consideration. 

The Steak Frite at dinner was excellent."
168,4,"The little dress shop is hit and miss, fashion and price wise. Love some of their styles, hate others. Most of the time their dresses are out of my price range, but every now and then I'll find something great for a great price.

But MOST importantly, the Little Dress Shop now has a VINTAGE section. Super cute dresses for SUPER reasonable prices. Many of the vintage dresses are priced in the $20-$40 range. Definitely worth checking out!"
169,4,"Yes, good sheeeeeiiiiiiittttt!!!  I could eat Mexican food everyday, but, it just doesn't seem all that healthy to do.  Fortunately, for those of you like me, we now have Sharky's.  

Sharky's seems to take a little bit more pride than most of your faster food places.  It's very clean and everything is made to order.  I also like how they emphasize the healthier items on the menu and they don't sound like, ""crappy"" healthy items, where, they just took all the lowest cal stuff and threw it into a tortilla.  

The service has always been very friendly and they do have a couple of tables outside, although, they are on the sidewalk."
170,4,"Fantastic garlic fries, great black bean and tempeh burgers!"
171,2,"I was in town briefly to pick up my brother-in-law and bring him home for the holidays.  I've eaten a bunch of great food over the years in Ann Arbor, and figured as cosmopolitan of a small town as it is, I could trust the Yelp 4.5 stars.  4.5 stars!?!

This place was a real disappointment.  The only reason I am not giving it 1 star is because I've only been once, and I suppose it's possible something horrible happened before I got there and I like to give people the benefit of the doubt.  That said...

I am disappointed in you, Ann Arbor Yelpers!  I can imagine the stars are mostly a function of drunken stumblers, but I assumed plenty of the inebriated would be from a city with a decent enough hot dog base line to know that these hot dogs are terrible. And yes, I saw all the reviews about the lobster bisque, but I was there on a Wednesday and just figured the hot dogs had to be ok.

And were that to be it, I suppose I would be only so disappointed.  Except as a back up to the fact I didn't see anything about the dogs when quickly skimming on my phone, I asked the guy at the shack about the dogs: were they good, were they all beef, were they Vienna or some other well known high quality brand?  ""Yeah, they're good"" with the dismissiveness that I clearly mistook for the arrogance of one who is disappointed in a doubter (4.5 stars!?!).  I guess it was just the laziness of someone who wants to go home for the holidays.  That's cool dude, but I definitely should have chosen the noodle shop across the street.

I rarely do a review like this, but seriously Le Dog and Ann Arbor people - step your game up.  The hot dog is nearly flavorless - I'd say a 2 out of 10.  There has to be a better dog for the same cost out there for you to use, unless you are actively choosing the cheapest hot dog possible (which very well may be the case, and given that people keep reviewing you well, I guess you may be run by a MBA who got an A+ in capitalism class).

Oh, and the polish sausage, which I also ordered, is awful as well."
172,2,"Memo's only redeeming quality?  They're open 24 hours a day.

But if you've got a craving for mediocre, salty burritos, then look no further!  Your prayers have been answered. 

Just remember to let the bathroom air out for a couple hours when you're done with it..."
173,2,"Came for brunch on Tuesday early noon. The place was not packed at all, and there was three staff serving. I had to wait more than 5 minutes to place my order, as no one would take it (the woman at the counter was talking on the phone, the rest was walking around ignoring me).

After ordering a delicious-looking salmon sandwich, I sat at my table and waited 17 (SEVENTEEN) minutes for it. It's a sandwich, honestly, what could take so long? The only explanation I came up with is they had no salmon available and had to run to the nearby Target to buy some.

The dish was OK, a sandwich is a sandwich though. The bread was better than average American bread, but not of European quality -- too full of air (source: I'm European). Definitely not worth the $10 it cost me.

Would not come here again."
174,4,"Try a pastrami sandwich.

As soon as you're done with that, feel free to send me a Thank You card.

Unlike the pastrami, their bagel lox is just so-so. Theirs is one of the biggest I've had - they pile on the salmon and trimmings - but not exactly bursting with flavor. On the other hand, it's good enough to save you a trip to NYC."
175,5,"One of two high end restaurants worth eating at in Princeton. (The other being another seafood restaurant, The Ferry House.) The raw oysters are excellent here. Whole grilled fish is usually great, once was burnt. The orange glazed scallops appetizer is delicious. The prices are expensive, but not for the quality you get. There are a lot of expensive restaurants in Princeton and most of them are not worth any of your money. The outside seating is nice, but they do not take reservations, which means a long wait during certain weeks (graduation, etc) as well as Friday and Saturday nights after 5pm."
176,4,"If you're looking for a good happy hour, love mac n cheese, and want a nice place to chill with friends, then definitely check this place out especially on a Wednesday night. You can park on the street in front or in the lot across the street for the old Borders/Macy's. I had called to make a reservation for a group of 7, but it wasn't super crowded when we got there like a lot of places in LA. Nonetheless, a few tables near the couches were reserved for us.

If you get there before 7:30 pm, you can take advantage of the Happy Hour which includes 30% off anything on the food menu and discounted select drinks except for their signature cocktails. My friends and I really liked the mojitos, especially since you can choose from a few flavors... the best were the guava and mango mojitos, not too sweet and very refreshing. Be sure to order up before 7:30 though, because the waiter told us that once it hits 7:30, the computers automatically change the pricing. 
-French Fry Trio: this was a lot of fun to eat and is good if you're sharing. We got to mix and match the yukon gold potatoes, sweet potato, and classic fries with the 3 different dipping sauces. I would rank the sauces from most liked to least liked as follows: garlic aioli, chili honey saucem bbq ranch. We demolished the first two sauces, but there was a lot of the bbq ranch left over... it sounds good in concept, but it just didn't have that addicting factor.
-Fried calamari with homemade cocktail sauce and garlic aioli: We got a decent amount of calamari and the pieces were pretty big. Can never get enough of garlic aioli.

Now on to the main attraction of the night and the main reason we came here... AYCE Mac n Cheese after 8 pm on Wednesdays for only $5 :) This is their Sugar's Mac n Cheese: white cheddar, gruyere, romano cheese, green onions, baked with a sourdough crust. Our group was lucky enough that they set the pan with the mac n cheese very close to where we were sitting. For the AYCE, it's self serve, so be sure to keep an eye out when a new batch comes out. We all really liked the sourdough crust and coined them ""crunchies"" because it added a nice texture to eat with the mac n cheese. Gruyere and romano cheese is such a great combination and I liked that their version wasn't too gooey or watered down. The only thing is that the mac n cheese didn't come out as fast as we had hoped since each batch would go quickly. Our group ate about half the pan each time, but service was decent overall as they frequently came by to check on us.

Would definitely like to come back again sometime."
177,2,"This was my second time at Salt Creek and I was very disappointed. Service was okay, food was poor. We ordered the grilled chop and a brisket sandwich. Both were over-cooked and dry. Not worth the money we spent. Highly doubt I would recommend this to anyone."
178,5,"Our final resting place: Ave Crawl bar #10.

I will gladly give College Inn 5 stars.  I have always had a great time here. It's a perfect place for large groups - especially  if you can get the room in the back for some piano action.  Your group can be fairly secluded, so if college kids bother you its easy to avoid them for the most part. 

Our group has had many birthdays here and my graduate program has most of its happy hour event here as well.  I will say without hesitation this is my favorite bar on the Ave."
179,5,This Sur La Table has the best service!  Such gracious staff and great offerings. I hope to take a cooking class there this year.
180,5,"Good god this place still rocks my socks!! I was here this past weekend and went with friends during dinner, which meant we were put in a tiny corner with tiny tables. It is def not the best time to eat there, since Club Passim takes over the whole shebang.

However, the food is still amazing! The caesar salad is just how I remembered, which is to say a great mixture of salty (parm cheese and olives), crunchy (broccoli), tangy (tomatoes), and pillowy awesomeness (fried tofu croutons - perhaps my fav part). I ordered the daily special over brown rice, but the Safe and (Un)sound was delicious on ciabatta and I prob should have stuck to my usual (Henry's lunch).

Sadly, the pizza oven was broken so pizza was not an option. They were serving local ciabatta bread as an alternative till the oven was back and running, and I made the mistake of opting for brown rice instead. Good thing my friends got the ciabatta. It was AMAAAZING!!! Super fluffy with a light crust, delicious yeasty bready flavor. My god. I was so dumb for not getting the sandwich. and for a meal around $7, you can't beat that. I'm so used to the high prices of DC that this seems like such a steal to me. I still always come here every time I visit Boston. I love you Veggie Planet!! Wish I could come more often. :("
181,5,"I just moved to Pasadena and found this spa on Yelp.  I'm glad I went because I walked in with very stressed out skin and walked out with baby soft skin.  Shirley is very warm and welcoming and she knows her stuff.  She looked at my skin, provided a great consultation and suggested a microdermabrasion.  In addition to the facial she also provided a great massage to my hands, arms, feet, legs and shoulders.  I almost fell asleep, it was sooo relaxing!  She even went over her time limit (my face was a mess) and did not charge me extra!  Best of all, she doesn't push products on you.  Her services are very well priced for what you get.  I highly suggest anyone to go here.

I have found my new facialist :)"
182,5,"Okay, I really feel the need to clear up a few confusing assumptions about credit card usage here.

First off, this CENTRAL location (GUADALUPE) DOES ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS! There are only two exceptions:

1) There is a $5 minimum (No, you cannot ask the cashier to add a dollar as tip to make it $5. The completed purchase has to total $5 or more)

2) NO AMERICAN EXPRESS ACCEPTED!

So, if you're looking to buy yourself a drink it's going to be around $4 or less. Also, be sure not to ask for extra pearls or jellies as this will only put you at $4.75 or less. Bring a friend, cash, or you can purchase one of the different flavored Pocky's/Pucca that they have (between $2-$4.50), or you can get food to-go from their menu. The most popular being the Vegetable Egg Rolls which are $2 and quick to make, or the complementary soup to-go which is $1.

The NORTH location of CoCo's (yes, there are two) on RESEARCH BLVD./183 IS CASH ONLY! Likewise, if you come into this place, make sure you have cash. If you find yourself stuck in a no-cash situation, they just installed an ATM so you're covered!"
183,1,"What's up with the surly employees at these upscale bakeries in this town? I've already abandoned A***'s in Va.Highlands bc of such poor service & I'm really thinking I might have to do the same with Bakeshop!
But it's so convenient to my house & a great spot to meet up with neighborhood friends for a cup of coffee & a morning pastry. 
The self serve coffee is nice and strong and fortunately requires limited interaction with the grouchy cashier! The pastries are quite good too and the smell of the breads is wonderful, but the service is a horror.
I think I had pleasant service, once upon a time, long long ago.
Today I stopped in for a slice a carrot cake - that looked so beautiful and enticing in the case.
For $4, the slice was at its width ~1.5"", and was so crumbled by the time the Grouchy Cashier sliced it & got it into the to-go container, it looked like all she did was scrape the remains of previous slices off the knife & scooped it into the box.And btw, it wasn't so good.
Looks like I'll be walking a short block further north to Empire State South from now on.
I'm  small business owner and if ever any of our staff approached any client with such non chalance and indignance as Grouchy Cashier AND  had the nerve to suggest a TIP, I would fire myself for being a bad boss."
184,4,"I've never been to an IMAX theater ever. It just never happened for me. It's funny because I've been to the one in Cherry Hill, but after being to the Tuttleman I now realize that the one in Cherry Hill isn't even an IMAX, it's just a really big screen (shame on you cherry hill!) However, the other even we ventured to see Harry Potter at the IMAX at FI and it was quite the experience. The theater itself just has such a different feel to it. Like being on a ride instead of actually in a movie. 

I would like to note that it was difficult to watch the movie. It's just too damn big. (insert comedic look here). I literally couldn't figure out what was going in some of the faster paced scenes simply because I couldn't get my eyes around the whole scene fast enough to keep up. 

Still it was a very cool experience, and I'd give it a try in the future. And don't even get my started on how great HP is, because well you should just go see it for yourself!"
185,3,"The atmosphere is more upscale with its wooden tables, dimmed lightning, real flower in vases, and decor. Staff is very courteous, accommodating, and well... generally good looking. 

Since it's new there were a lot of open tables when my friends and I visited so it can accomodate big groups of 10 or more . It is similar to Palomino, but it's happy hour choices need to be more than just the $5 martinis if it wants to be more competitive. The $3 garlic fries for happy hour is a no brainer to order. The apple cobbler is also delicious. Highly recommended.  Great addition to Westwood and definitely worth checking out on a night of merrymaking and barhopping (it's literally a few steps down from BrewCo!)"
186,4,"I found myself having a philosophical debate during zumba class at this studio.  The question was:  ""what am I looking for in a zumba class?""

I had read the reviews about Twice Balanced before I attended class, and the 2 star review has valid points: if you are a regular zumba goer, you might be surprised by some of the instructor's moves and the pace can be...ummm...non-scientific, I'll say that.

But the 5 star reviews really focus on Christy - and she is the reason to go.  She has a great, infectious energy.  She is kind and fun.  I think she embodies zumba spirit because it's about fun - not perfection of moves - and I get annoyed when I go to classes where it becomes a (sorry to say it) ""pissing contest"" about who goes the hardest or the best.

I prefer dance-type zumba classes, with a good amount of challenge in the choreography, lots of hip movement, not too much high impact.  This class is pretty energetic, more energetic than finesse, and they have quite a bit of jumping - but you may modify as needed.

There were 12 people in the class today - I talked to a bunch of the regulars after class.  This is the right fit for them, and the atmosphere is one of acceptance and kindness...so, give it a try if you're new to zumba.  For $5, you really can't go wrong!!"
187,5,"Shannon has completely changed my skin!  I had doubts that I would find someone in the East Bay to replace my amazing person in SF for facials.  With two kids now, I couldn't make it there anymore, but I am more than happy now that I have found Studio Abasi.  Ever since going to Shannon and using her amazing product line, I have had glowing skin.  She really knows her stuff and aims for getting you the results you want.  Her new space is beautiful. On top of that, she is the nicest person you'll meet.  Her products are top quality and reasonably priced too."
188,2,Something completely wrong happened to this place somewhere in the middle of last year: they stopped serving regular beer and started serving their own beers. I'd rather drink keystone than the crap they were serving there. Karaoke can either be funny or just plain obnoxious. The staff and bartenders are very nice.
189,4,"Well i was introduced to this place from a friend going to Harvard...(oooh lala) 

But wait this place is Nice Nice!!!
better known and Nocch's (i was corrected by my friend) Oooh lala 

But you order the Sicilian slice its really the best way to go.. i prefer the tomato basil it seems to be the most popular so ur most likely to get a fresher piece cuz they seem to make it more often.. 

the the crust is flaky doughy and buttery... some people say the Sicilian slices have too much bread.. but hey if the bread is well made and good then no problem in my book.. 

they have good deals for 2 slices you might as well go for it.... 
so basically check it out.. its open late and always seems to satisfy"
190,5,"Definitely my favorite dress-up dinner and drinks restaurant. The decor is elegant, especially with all the dark wood and tea lights. A great place for an expensive date.

I've never been disappointed with their food and I've had appetizers, full dinner and dessert there. I highly recommend the Artisan Cheese Plate with a Zinfandel (they've recommended Rosenblum). The creme brulee is fantastic as well as the bread pudding (I didn't think I'd be a fan but I was proven wrong). Last week they had a special of Artic Char with a lemon beurre blanc sauce with capers, fingerling potatoes and broccolini (if I remember correctly). It was amazing! 3 of us at the table had ordered it and all enjoyed it. The martinis are wonderful though occasionally I think $10 for a drink is a bit much, but then that's just the way of Blue: everything's a bit pricey.

Service is typically very good. No one's overly snobby and they do take reservations for larger groups. I had a group of 10 and they seated us in the dining area and were ready for us as soon as we arrived. Our server was politely attentive and was even so kind as to let us know gratuity had been included in the check after we were about to leave a large tip on the table. And since it was my birthday they brought out a Bananas Foster with a candle as my dessert.

The crowd is generally late 20s and up. If you're a young, single female, beware: I've seen my share of wandering eyes as I've enjoyed dinner and a drink alone. Still, it's a wonderful restaurant. Even my casual dining-loving parents enjoyed it."
191,4,"girls seeks fun cocktail and unique atmosphere.

taste in my mouth (from small plated dishes not to be confused with the term tapas) explodes with unbelievable flavor (take my money!).

drinks from the bar squad turn me from quiet butterfly to loud squall (mmm....hendricks blackberry and basil, Salome's something, strange but truly engaging - a conversation starter).

kind service is tops. though controversial, they brought me a dipping cup filled with that mesmerizing lemon wine sauce typically accompanied with the fried stuffed artichoke amazement (in my mouth). they served this with a pound of bread. why for a person in singular? not so sure. coulda fed an army.

ladies in flapper gear.  handsome bartenders.  unisex bathrooms.  food and drink.  you others nearby stink.  

and cuchi cuchi tickles my cuchi."
192,5,"Gosh I love it here. The Mexican deep fried tomato, the tuna tar tare cornets,  seafood stuffed avocado it is all so GOOD. You know the beginning part of Salt & Pepa's ""Push It"" when the guy says that this song is  for ""only the sexy people?"" ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCV5yGKWjv4  1:28 min)
He's talking about people who eat here.
The Best Cambridge has to offer. Seduce your friends & co workers here!"
193,3,"Okaaay....so we actually ended up here after trying some other bars down the street; however, those were uber packed and my boyfriend just wanted to watch Monday night football.  Anyways...Publik was definitely a pleasant surprise.  

The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Great selection of beers, especially enjoyed the Georgia brews.  Cocktails were interesting....the Green Vipor..small glass...BIG taste. lol its served in a martini glass...seemingly not so attractive to the ""manly man""...but it def. does the trick. 

Food was great...quick service. The only reason why Publik gets a 3 in our opinion...is because they only have about 3 TVs and theyre not big.  Also..the menu could be a little more extensive.  But this is a great first date place/corner bar/chill spot with friends.  Def. enjoyed!"
194,5,"Teh dope!

I'm not much for the oatscreme myself, but lotsa folks dig it. I haven't tried the float yet though, that may just be the winner when I finally pick one up. The nochix salad and reuben sandwiches are To Die For. All of the baked stuff is spectacular and the coffee is fair-trade and wonderful. I'd hit that!  ;-p"
195,4,"I think I ate here once a week because my boyfriend was absolutely obsessed with it. For one, no matter what you order make sure you get it with their cornbread. SO AMAZING!!! And everything really is made healthier there. Their garlic fries will for sure make you smell like garlic so don't go on a date or to an interview afterwards!!! Their avocado chicken burgers are a fav of mine and their corn chowder I have to learn how to make...mmmmmmm"
196,2,"This salon is very nice, clean and newer. Although, the thing that bothered me about going here is after buying my tanning package, every single time I went to tan; a staff member tried to imply me to spend more money.  Can I just tan and if I need/want something I'll ask? I can't stand that type of selling pressure when dealing with tanning salons. I haven't been back since, even though this is the cloest tanning salon to my house, I drive further for a less pressure atmosphere."
197,2,"I know they're working with a small space, but so are most businesses in Boston, and their configuration here just isn't working.  It took finagling to get myself and my friend through the front door and foyer.  The doors open awkwardly, and one of them doesn't even look like a door.  It took us a minute standing in the foyer to figure out that the next door wasn't just a wall hanging.  Inside the restaurant, the tables are put far too close together.  My friend had to repeatedly pull her chair in so close to the table that her stomach was touching it just to give other people enough room to get by.  The elderly couple at the table next to us may as well have been sitting with us.  They were so close that we could hear their entire dinner conversation, and they even turned to us to talk to us like we were part of their party several times.  

As for the food, now I've never had Tibetan food before.  It's entirely possible that as far as Tibetan food goes, this is top-notch.  All I can say is, it was bland.  It was almost as bland as undergraduate cafeteria food.  I'd heard Tibetan food is like Indian food, only less spicy, but this essentially had no spice at all.  It could be that I just don't like Tibetan food, though, so take that with a grain of salt.

Overall, I just didn't think the food and experience were worth the money."
198,3,"Basil Thai would not make any one's top ten Thai list if they included places outside of C-U, but it's well worth a stop if you 're hungry in the area.  The space is a bit sparse, yet it's pleasantly decorated. 

Decent is the watchword for Basil Thai.  The place feels like a gussied up cafeteria with nice little touches.  The curry was...okay.  It was my fault for trying to be super manly and ordering it as extra spicy, and they delivered, but of course that obscured the full range of the curry's flavor for me.  And I went through four glasses of water.  But that's how things go.

So if you've learned anything from this review, please remember: Basil Thai is decent, and masculinity is not safely garnered by eating super spicy stuff."
199,5,"I loved it here! First off, it's a super-small place, but is designed really classily and cleanly. Definitely an upscale cupcake experience. Yes, it's a little pricey, over three dollars for one cupcake, but c'mon, who needs to buy this stuff all the time? My best friend and I made a special trip here from Santa Cruz, and it was totally worth it! I got the lemon and s'mores cupcake, she got the red velvet and s'mores. WOW. The second-best lemon cupcake I've had. Granted, if you don't like super-sweet cupcakes, this place probably isn't for you. However sweet they are, it didn't make me feel sick or overloaded with food, surprisingly. Anyways, the lemon frosting was delicious and the cupcake itself wasn't dry at all. The s'mores was SUPER decadent, and messy! A graham cracker crust bottom, chocolate cake with some sort of chocolate ganache center, and toasted marshmallow on top. Crazy. If you're a fan of chocolate cake and s'mores, look no further than this cupcake. I know how popular the red velvet is, so I guess there's no need to elaborate on that one. Overall, a great experience! The only think I don't really get about the place is that regardless of the business inside the store, they take your name for the cupcakes to be ""boxed"" and call you back moments later. Sort of seems like a waste of time if you're only getting one or two cupcakes. Just saying."
200,4,"Best cup of coffee in town, I suggest ordering the coffee of the day.

It's a bit expensive since they raise prices and the food is definitely nothing special. I'm also docking them for shortening their hours open so its hard for me to grab coffee later at night when I really need it. Had I written this review before the price and hours change, it would have been a five star. Definitely a place to go."
201,4,"As a student that is always in the northeast corner of campus, this is my go-to place for a late breakfast or lunch. It's usually quiet, and I can get in and out in 30 minutes. The food isn't mind-blowing, but they use real ingredients and it's much better than any other food options nearby."
202,5,"I went here for the first time last Saturday, and let me just elaborate on how amazing this restaurant is!

The menu does not have very many items on it, but you crave every dish, even if you are not feeling terribly hungry like I was.  For the first plate, the Choucroute Garni is a MUST!

We got the Pork and Beans and the special steak, which was the Delmonico cut  8 oz.. Both were prepared to perfection! The pork melted in your mouth, and the steak was a perfect medium rare with a nice charred exterior. Plus, the sauces and vegetables went very well with the dishes.

For those who are interested in the after-dinner drink selection, Hungry Mother has quite a few options. We were most impressed by the Whiskey selection. If you are a bourbon fan, I would highly recommend the Pappy tasting -- 13 year Rye, Family Reserve 20 yr, and Family Reserve 23 yr for $31.

To top it all off, the waitress and hostess were both extremely nice. (The hostess also mentioned that, if you arrive before 6:30 pm, they can get movie tickets at the Landmark Theatre in Kendall Square for $7 and bring it to your table.)"
203,5,"Why did it take me this long to try this place out?! Absolutely a hidden gem in College Park and I can only thank fate that this isn't within walking distance of campus, or else I would eat here every day. 

DEFINITELY go for the naan pizza. It's the size of a personal pan pizza, and you get to customize it with a variety of masala sauces, chutneys, and toppings... think of it as Chipotle with an Indian flair. And, no, it's not really the same as Krazi Kebob--this concept is ingenious. You can choose between a variety of meats (includes your standard beef, lamb, or chicken) and diced veggies such as tomatoes, onions, chickpeas, cheese, paneer, cilantro, etc. Then it all goes into the oven for a few minutes, and out comes a steaming hot, delightfully crisp naan pizza!

I was pleased with the texture of the naan as well as the flavors... the chutney sauce is delicious and adds the perfect amount of sweetness to balance out the spice of the masala and meat seasoning. The chicken wasn't dry at all, and there was a generous portion of it on the ""pizza"".

For $7, the size and flavors are definitely worth the price. I can't wait to come back and try some other things on the menu. Also, the place is really clean and offers a lot of indoor + outdoor seating, so the atmosphere is definitely another plus. An all-around awesome establishment."
204,4,"Indian bread is great. I don't eat meat from this place... I don't think it would be very good. But the veggie noodles, fried rice, and veggie indian bread are good. Not the best, but far better than what you would expect considering the price and from a stand and all. The indian bread is $1.50 and it's big enough for an ok lunch. Another thing... they  don't have noodles on Fridays. I always forget and get real disappointed. 

Their strawberry lemonade is really good. The old lady is nice, and her son or whatever on the other side of campus is nice too. They're good people. I like to give them my money because you know it sucks standing in that little stand every day."
205,1,"The name does not reflect the quality here. 

We had lunch here today after a pretty stressful weekend, so we were expecting it to be good. Wrong. 

Today was a beautiful spring day and we wanted to soak in the rays and people watch while enjoying good French food. The outdoor seating area was empty. The hostess put us at a 2-top and when I asked to be seated at the 4-top in the sun, her reply was that the place would fill up. But for some reason, I didn't think this would be true. Anyhow, the 2-top was awkward and it was on a downward slope and so my friend felt like she was being thrust forward throughout the whole meal. 

My friend ordered the pre-fixe ($18), which included a pumpkin soup and  moules and frites. I ended up with a burger. The moules was a small portion size and really not enough food.  My burger was decent. Nothing exciting. 

Now here is the kicker. My friend gets a dessert with her pre-fixe. The waiter asks if I also want a dessert. Now, since my friend was having one, I assented to having a dessert. But before I could even glance at the menu, they brought out her dessert. So at this point, I opted out.

Timing is everything and the waiter messed this one up. 

In any case, the food was mediocre, the service was meh, and the table outside was on a slope. Not much you can do to save this place..."
206,4,"If you did not know anything about this place, you would not think that this is a chain.  The food is great and does not taste ""chainy"" at all like other large chain restaurants.  Plus they have an amazing dark roast coffee.

I was there twice over a family weekend in Houston.  I had their biscuits and gravy on one occasion and their three cheese omelet on my second visit.  The food was fresh, hot, and great tasting comfort food at its best."
207,5,This was a hidden gem in the fast paced world of cuisine in NY. Service was the best and they made me fall in love with duck!!! on e of the best meals I have ever had
208,3,"If you're in the middle of an emotional breakdown, tears streaming down your face as you contemplate the life you've chosen, you really want a brunch place that pays attention to the details of your order.  In my case, I was supposed to have been weeping about the choices I've made over a side of grits, not breakfast potatoes.  The Huevos that sat before me as I reflected upon the abandoned dreams of my childhood were supposed to come with cheddar cheese.  Alas, they did not.  And it would have been nice if the Irish Coffee I'd ordered had arrived much sooner than it did.  As it were, I had a good fifteen to twenty minutes to meditate on the sad but necessary transition into adulthood that every man must face without the soul-soothing taste of Bailey's in my mouth.

Although the food that arrived wasn't exactly what I ordered, it was pretty good for what it was.  It wasn't spectacular by any means, but neither is the fact that, as Walden so eloquently stated, the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.

My special lady friend got some sort of biscuits and poached eggs and it looked much more appetizing than what I had ordered.  That having been said, the next time I'm having an existential crisis I think I will go somewhere else for brunch."
209,2,"I used to go here frequently, but I got sick of being charged for every extra thing (peppers, sour cream, etc).  In the end Chipotle ends up being higher quality AND cheaper if you get the extras.  On top of that, their hours are all over the place.  Chipotle is open more frequently.

The only reason to go here now is the Queso burrito, but the downsides outweigh the good.  It's worth waiting in line at Chipotle."
210,3,"3.5 stars. excellente waffles, kindly service, annoying art, sometimes lame bands. very ""ann arbor""."
211,4,After a long night of trying to share a twin bed with my boyfriend for the first time in a LONG time Hummingbird Cafe's coffee was exactly what the doctor ordered. It was a blissful cup of perfection to start the day off right. I will be back the next time such an event is in my cards.
212,1,"""What is that smell...?""


The food here is decent. The service is pathetic. Myself and a group of ladies decided to try this place for lunch last week. Big Mistake!! The service was pathetic. The casheir was very rude and unapologetic. Our order took FOREVER to come out. When our food finally arrived it was extremely greasy and the roti was burnt! As we were leaving we noticed a putrid odor eminating from a door which led to the basement. This led me to wonder where the letter grade was that is supposed to be posted in the window. My friend decided to investigate further. Here is what she found:

**EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK**"
213,4,"Extreme dim lights ,people everywhere and good smell coming from the tiny kitchen.
   
   Apart from the crazy designs they have on the wall;i did keep starring at them until i was there and i think most of them were dragons or atleast looked like them.

    I ordered the Golden tofu and i love it for two reasons
a.It is tofu :D
b.it had biscotti texture on the outside

Woah!! Biscotti filled with soya who wouldn't love it?? I definitely do!! I went to this place twice and i ordered the same thing.Not my fault!! *Keeps a sad doggy face* they do not have many vegetarian choices .

   But it is  a great place to go hang out with friends and try talking.Note the point TRY TALKING.That's because they play the music so loud like a club,therefore by the time you are out of the place you have lost your voice or your ear drums.But don't worry you shall survive with the yummy food :)

   wow!! This all explains the name MAD Mex :)

-Smriti"
214,5,"Most wonderful smoothie cart ever.  When it returned after the winter, I was so happy I nearly cried.  You can't get much more delicious and nutrious than this place, and the fellow who works in the afternoons and evenings (is he the owner?) is indeed a great guy.  Just ask him what is fresh that day, and he'll make you a delicious drink.  The juices are really spectacular too.  Try an avocado-banana smoothie sometime!"
215,5,"I have loved this place ever since I made a reservation for 5 people and showed up with 14 and they happily found us a table and were as nice as they could be.  It wasn't my fault (some out of town friends had misinformed me about the size of their party) but still.  I love taking people here because the atmosphere is warm, the murals are charming and bring back good memories, and the food is consistently good.  It changes often enough to keep it interesting and yet one can find old favorites.  I also like to sit at the bar and read and have a couple of drinks.  There are always attractive & interesting people to eavesdrop on, and the bar staff leave me alone (in a nice way) but seem to know when I want a drink.  Except the other night when one young woman kept trying to sell me another when I still had plenty in my glass.  I hate that, but not enough to deduct a star.  She reads the reviews I hope and will get over her bad little habit as a result.

Bar menu suggestion for them:  HOMEMADE POTATO CHIPS.  Don't thank me, you'll sell zillions of them.  Those $5 olives are getting a little old. I'd gladly pay $8 for a plate of homemade potato chips.

This is also a good place to see famous people if you care about that sort of thing.  It's the only restaurant in Cambridge where I have seen bona fide movie stars.  Fun!"
216,4,"mostly kitchen stuff.  good selection of cutting boards, knives, random gadgets, even pet bowls and pet place mats.

good place to wander for a bit but pricey.

when I was there last I spent about 10 minutes looking at ceramic pigs and sheep."
217,5,"It's worth going here even if it is just to get the cranberry bread. Their breads are so good and fresh, it is almost like eating cake! I should add that I have not eaten other foods here, just the breads, so I can't comment on anything else."
218,4,"Visited last night for dinner.  Vegetable pakora appetizer, lamb in spicy lentils (GOSHT DAL BASANTI) and roti.  All were very good.  Service was good except that all food was brought at the same time.  Not a big deal for us last night as we were ready to eat.  I would definitely go back."
219,5,"This is always on the top of my list for great food in Pittsburgh .  I'm never disappointed by the portions or the taste or the price.  The decor suits the rather 'hole in the wall' kind of vibe that it gives off with the mismatched chairs and the cosy tables.  The pad thai is always a great standby with a great sauce that is pretty sweet and quite red, and oh so tasty.  Everything I have ordered has been very flavorful and never overcooked.  The portions are huge, although I often find myself finishing the whole thing.  They also have a tea menu and now serve beer and wine (although they still accept BYOWine there is a $10 corkage fee)."
220,5,"Chapel Hillians (is that a thing?) should count themselves lucky that this bar can be a part of their regular routine. I wish my town had a place as classy, with such interesting drinks and clientele. The vibe of the polished, sleek bar, was complimented by the bartender in his bow tie, offering up creative libations and recommendations for those of us that were intimidated by the unique concoctions. 

Absolutely worth stopping in if you're strolling Franklin Street."
221,1,"I really wanted to love Louis, because, well, everyone else seems to....but ugh, sick city.
I literally felt like I had just stepped out of the Twilight Zone when left Louis, but I don't think the sick feeling I had for 2 days after was from time travel. I think it was from the memories of the mayonaise caked burger or some fallen residue off the 50 year old blackish-brown (once white) apron worn by a strange staff member. 
Loved the outside and inside Art work, appreciate the old school quirky vibe, but when someone is at your table every 45 seconds removing a straw wrapper or the plate you are eating your sandwich over (while still eating said sandwich), its time to accept the fact that you just can't hop on this bandwagon. Not to mention, the food, unfortunately, just wasn't good.
All I kept thinking after leaving was,damn, I should have and wish I would have, gotten totally sh!* faced before going to Louis. Maybe then, and only then, I could like it too..."
222,3,"This place is simply Campo with a new name. Food is nothing special, but it's a nice place to sit outside on a nice night. I had the risotto which wasn't anything special, but my companion had excellent sirloin tips. Service was efficient and friendly."
223,5,"I decided to try this garage because of Yelp, and yall did not steer me wrong. Like Casey, my car is old and ripe for overselling, but these guys fixed the problem without trying to take advantage. 

Great communication: the inspection, oil change and repair took exactly the amount of time they said and cost exactly the amount of money they said (which was less than other city garages). All in all, a smooth and hassle-free experience, and my car's running great. I will be going to Lei's from here on out!"
224,2,"The $8.50 lunch buffet special is the only thing that makes this restaurant worth it at all. I have had eating contests with other people, including OBeast, to see how many tacos we can eat. The carnitas are pretty darned good, so are the enchiladas and plantains in the buffet. I wouldn't go here any other time of the day--it isn't worth the price or the general quality of the food.."
225,1,"You can never return home!!! I rarely, I mean rarely return home to Palo Alto (even though I really don't live that far away),  but sometimes I get a little homesick & miss that warm friendly small town feel. Burberry is not the place to go warm friendly treatment. For a minute I thought that Palo Alto had lost it wholesome innocent feel, maybe it lost its sense of self due to the hussle & bussle of everyday life. No, it's just Burberry one of their associates is a judgemental pompous a--. I'll admit maybe I looked a little rough (being that I was unshaven) & a little hip hop but had she taken a closer look she might had noticed that I was wearing a $150 tee shirt, $300 jeans, & $300 shoes. My girl had on whatever by whoever & the associate had the nerve to ask her if she worked in the mall!?! What!!!  Honestly I could tell by her body language that she thought that I was there to steal something. So to accommodate I decided to wait outside while my girl shopped & leave the jacket I wanted in the store. Even though my girl was irrated she couldn't resist ordering a pair of pants. I wish she had, had another associate ring them up. Customer service here sucks, I'll never return!!!"
226,3,"I thought I was would just be in and out of here especially since the Kinko's worker was so quick and helpful. Little did I realize I was about to lose an hour of my precious life here as I sat there staring at a fax machine for 47 MINUTES, That's right- It took 47 minutes to fax 23 pages. Someone tell me if this is typical for a fax machine. I've never wanted to throw something out a window so badly."
227,5,"This is the real deal for a cheese steak. Simply in a class above any other in town. Their style of bread is something I haven't seen in Texas before. At first the love was all for the quality meat and extra cheese. Now I love the bread too, it keeps the meaty and cheesey goodness in line without getting soggy.  If you are a fan of other cheesesteaks in town, this will kind of ruin the others for you, once you see what you've been missing. The people that work here are solid, you can tell they enjoy what they do - making a great sandwich.

I'm honestly suprised they aren't common knowledge city wide by now. They are in a great location for downtown and capital area lunchbreaks. That block seems dead after 5, but that's good as it's always quick service for their dinner shift.  Maybe that block will liven up when the condos across the street open."
228,4,Tried the Banana Split and it was ok. Most of the good flavors were gone by the end of the day. So I opted for frosting shots. Yum! I'm glad they had both sugar and buttercream options.
229,4,"This place is growing to be one of my absolute favorites for Vietnamese cuisine. I've ordered food from here twice now. One time, the lady and I went in to sit down, and today since we were sickly, we ordered for pick up.

I had a pineapple, tofu, and rice noodle vermicelli dish the first time which was phenomenal, and today I enjoyed their wonton soup.

Happy belly both times, that's for sure :) the menu is pretty extensive, and the staff is pretty nice too. 

Omnomnom, I shall be frequenting you, Thanh Vi. Thanks for having a location close to work and close to home for me :) woo!"
230,3,"I don't know what the big deal is about these cookies.  My brother always gets a box everytime we're here.  He loves these cookies.  They remind me of a bigger/fresher chips-ahoy.  

Personallly, I like the Mrs. Fields or Otis Spunkmeyer type cookies.  If you're from SF, Diddy Riese Cookies can't compare to Specialty's cookies.  

Maybe it's because they're so cheap that people like them alot.  Just get their ice cream cookie sandwich.  It's fresh!"
231,3,"Parking is tricky lol either youre lucky and find parking on the street..... they do have their own parking. If youre coming from Colorado Blvd, either way.... you turn on the street where McDonalds is at and turn right again right away on a lot and go all the way back until the end. On your right hand side there are like 10 parkings. Aside from that, I love their juicy crispy chicken (white meat of course) which you do have to wait about 10 minutes because they dont have white meat ready. Anyways also the chicken kabob is yummy but hardly any taste. My fav would be the beef kabob. If you want to subtitute your side for something else.... just let them know."
232,3,"I noticed this place a couple times during my jog to the park, and had it on my list of places to check out. I was really excited because the reviews seemed promising, but the food was average and not so cheap given the location/fact that the food is all premade + microwaved for you (~$8 a plate). My chicken curry was mostly bones; the naan was the chewy non-tandoori oven kind, the raita was watery and sad, and I didn't even want to touch the chicken tikka- it looked overly creamy. On the plus side, my friend enjoyed his goat curry. Of the veg options, the chana was good but the vegetable jalfrezi was a bit bland. The bathroom was surprisingly clean. Will I return? Probably, but only because of the dearth of decent and cheap Indian lunch spots in the area. Doaba deli is next on my list to try; will review soon!"
233,2,"Went here with my then GF on a spontaneous date.  Went to the bar first and had a couple of beers and while we perused the menu we both agreed that the offerings were 1) very over priced and 2) very meh.  Nothing really stood out and said to us 'hey  eat here.

So we went for sushi and had an amazing time"
234,5,"I have so many fond memories of Koronet's.  It generally involves one (or two) jumbo slices, extra sauce, a couple more minutes in the oven so the cheese could get melty meldy with the sauce, thrown in a to-go box, then trotted round the block to 1020 for a pint (or three) with dinner.  Those were the good ole days.  When Nickums and George were in the dentist's chair at the door and I got away with early evening Koronet's munching.

I'll also remember Koronet's for giving away free slices during the Blackout of 2003.  The epitome of a campus pizza joint.  I love you Koronet's."
235,3,"the fact that there's ethiopian/eritrean food in providence is exciting enough. im not an expert, but compared to a legit place i went to in san francisco, abyssinia has some good dishes. both times that i came here i ordered the combo platter to share with a friend. it's just the right amount of food and a good mix of everything if you're unsure of what to get. my biggest complaint with this restaurant is none of the food is warm/hot enough...it's always kind of room temperature or even cold, giving me the impression it was sitting out for a while or something. service is also pretty slow."
236,4,I like Zoe's because it's not as greasy as other diners (Mike's). The service is pretty quick and the food is tasty. The bathrooms are pretty nasty but they share it with another restaurant - oh well. I've only been for breakfast. Don't know what lunch is like.
237,4,"though it doesnt look like much on the outside, this is my most favorite Taiwanese place around. the food is delicous and affordable. 

vegetarians, be warned, not everything in the ""vegetable"" section of the menu is meat-free. for example, one or two of the bean curd dishes are cooked with pork, so if that kind of thing is important to you, make sure to tell yr waiter that you are a vegetarian."
238,5,A great place to watch baseball. Quaint and down to earth.
239,2,"Good price, but as one yelper also wrote, I got the wrong order, but decided not to complain mainly because I wasn't going to be coming back again.  We were looking for Bear Ramen, but it happened to be closed on this particular Sunday, so we ended up at the Thai restaurant.  We saw a lot of people in and out and thought the food must be good.  It was okay, but  there are probably better places in the area with a more friendlier cashier."
240,1,"I got yelled by the lady when I called to let them know I didn't receive the dumplings which I ordered along with other dishes. How dare they.

They have decent food but that doesn't matter to me anymore. I am never going back to this place ever again.

HOW DARE YOU YELL AT THE CUSTOMER ABOUT YOUR FAULT!"
241,1,"After a couple months of going to this place, using only the self-service laundry, I have some advice for new Bubbles patrons:

- Don't ever expect to be reunited with the ""refundable"" $3 you spend on the stupid laundry card.
- Don't get too attached to the clothes that you bring here because, inevitably, items will disappear.
- You are beholden to them for whatever amount of money you put on the card, so don't ever put more than $10 on it (or whatever amount you're comfortable throwing away because, inevitably, your card will disappear).
- Have fun finding a machine that works. Think of it like a casino, sometimes you put your money in a machine and get nothing. Sometimes you win a clean load of laundry.
- No seriously. Put aside all reasonable and logical expectations to get your money back when their equipment fails because the staff will claim they aren't ""allowed"" to give you a refund, no matter how small the amount."
242,2,"I came to this cafe for a last minute lunch visit and was unsure of what to expect since it was my first time there.  The place was 1/2 full and there was no one ahead of me waiting to be seated (it was 1:15pm).   I was approached by one of the host's when I came in the door.  He didn't say hi or welcome he just looked at me.  I asked how long of a wait for a table and he inquired if it was for one, which I told him yes.  He said he'd have to check (??? There were several tables open.....).  He never came back.  By then, another group of people came in behind me for a table of four.  At this time, a second host came up, overlooked me (I was standing at the podium) and asked them how many for lunch.  I guess my dart throwing stare caught his eye and he then looked at me and asked if I needed help.  I explained that another host was checking to see if a table was available but that he hadn't come back.  I was seated immediately.

My sever wasn't very friendly.  He never smiled, never made suggestions and never checked back with me during my lunch.

I ordered the Pan Bagnat sandwich, the green olives w/orange zest and the bread pudding with a cup of house coffee.  

I don't know what they were thinking when creating the tuna sandwich,  but I am sorry....... it was terrible.  The only good thing about it was the crusty french roll the tuna mixture was encased in.  It was served toasted and the bread was stuffed with a mixture of tuna, tomato, hard boiled egg, black olives, capers and celery.  The mixture was green so I am assuming it was all mixed with avocado.....  although, I don't recall the waiter mentioning avocado.  Bottom line was, there was no taste, the texture of the mixture was hard to get past along with the temperature of it.  I didn't find one caper in the sandwich and maybe there was a slice or two of olive.  

The green olives were boring, they tasted okay, but nothing to jump out at me and make me want to order them again.

The best part of my lunch was the bread pudding.  They hit it on the dot with that dish.  I could have shared it with someone, as the portion was very adequate.  It was well presented with a dollop of fresh whip cream on top and a lovely, light and sweet bourbon sauce. 

The restaurant is very nice, airy and open but the service needs polishing and the food needs an over-haul (At least the items I ordered).

I'm not sure if I'll return.  Maybe."
243,5,"My esthetician at Aromatique, April, is amazing. I have had numerous facials, and stress relief treatments from her, and would recommend her 100%. The atmosphere was relaxing and soothing, she was professional yet easy to talk to, and she did a wonderful job. I had never cared for facials prior to April, now I wish I could afford to have more! I have gone to other day spas, and had treatments from other professionals, but she is the best!"
244,4,"I wish this place accepted credit cards and had parking available because I would come here more often. I love their salads, I also love the hummus sandwich (never had hummus with mustard) so I first for me, but their salad beat anything else they sell. I love how everything is healthy and the atmosphere is so homely. This place is great to take out. I dont know why, but every time I've been there its been so dirty. People leave food on their tables and dont clean up. This is BERKELEY people, clean up your mess because .. no one else will! I'm from SoCal and I've gotten used to this ... so should you! 

Anyway, apart from that I think their food is above average and I dont have to worry about how many calories or fat their stuff has! Yaay! I've also tried their Italian sodas and they are delish :) Definitely one of my top 10 places in Berkeley :)"
245,2,"Desserts are what you do, and you charge more than just a pretty penny for them.  So why don't you WOW me?  The praline feuilletine would be fantastic if not for the the passion fruit curd.  Your apricot chardonnay sorbet is fine, but it tastes like I just picked it up at WholeFoods.  Even your signature Molten Chocolate is just...nice.  (Nice.  Not *thrilling*, but nice.)  Your cocktails are tasty and not insanely priced, and your staff are great, so there's that.  But really, it's supposed to be all about the desserts; instead, it's anything but."
246,5,"As awful as the LSAT seemed in the beginning (and at the end too), I am now in my first year of law school and WISH EVERYDAY that I could go back to Blueprint!!

It was an overall great experience. I had since recommended Blueprint to every single person who has mentioned any interest in going to law school. They are really amazing at what they do. Not only are the instructors entertaining, but I actually increased my score by 19 points! I don't mean to brag, but I think that is pretty impressive. They have a lot of variety in instructors (some people like small groups, others like humor) so they pretty much have something for everyone. I know a lot of people that have taken Blueprint courses at UCLA and at USC and I have yet to hear one complaint about them (no idea who these negative yelpers are..).

I also did their application workshop which helped TREMENDOUSLY. I don't remember exactly how much it was, but I remember getting a discount for being a former student. I walked in there with no clue as to I was going to write a personal statement and walked out with everything I needed to know, including my topic and an intro sentence. 

In relation to all of the other LSAT courses I checked out, they were actually the cheapest. I know they were about $500 cheaper than Testmasters for sure (and I actually have heard complaints about them from their former students). Overall, for a very reasonable price, 

Blueprint got me into one of my top choice schools with a pretty sweet scholarship, so I would say their performance speaks for itself at this point."
247,5,Intimate setting for a great show.
248,5,"This tapas restaurant is a great addition to a neighborhood that is quickly turning into a place to go for restaurants of all types and styles.  

They offer a varied menu that has something for everyone from smaller sampling plates to larger entrees that simply delight.  But do not forget to leave room for desert as there is several that are mouth watering endings for a wonderful dinner or lunch.

I would also be remiss if I did not mention the sangria.  White, red or fruit augmented, they are all great and serve to complement the meal very well.

I will be going back and strongly recommend everyone give them a shot.  You will not be disappointed."
249,5,"Service and food is excellent!!! We always sit at the bar when we come and we always get prompt exceptional service. Everything we have tried on the menu is great (except for the potato bread). The flaming banana sundae for dessert rocks! Order you a pitcher of Sangria and variety of tapas and you will be set for a good night. There is a band on Friday and Saturday nights, so it gets pretty crowded, but you are sure to have a good time."
250,4,"CENTRAL SQUARE - In a radical mid-year turn of events that delighted some and sorely disappointed others, Laura ""Wha Happen"" K tore herself away from CannoliFest 2K11, hopped on BIG RED and relocated from the tourist-ridden streetz of the North End (Peace Out Pauly!) to join the Yelpers and sidewalk-writhers of Central Square.*

But they got hot college chicks here but too many hipsters!

I'll deal with it for the hot chicks"
252,4,"my first time coming to san luis obispo in a really long time. Came here so my fiancé can visit his brother. Last time i was here...i was in fifth or sixth grade doing a report on the slo mission.  had to make it out of sugar cubes.  okay, i'm just reminiscing...let's get on with the review.

Excellent place (especially if you're new to the area, like i am) to hang out, and have good eats. I was the only one who didn't have the famous tri-tip sandwich.  I ordered the pork ribs which were awesome.  huge portion...i suggested my fiancé and i share it, but he said ""7 ribs isn't that much"".  and lo and behold, I had 3 whole ribs left.   

The fries are excellent, even though they have the fry seasoning that i'm not too fond of...but it did work with the rest of their menu.  Didn't try their onion rings, but all i can tell you is that are monster sized.   Salad vinaigrette dressing was awesome.   

Got nervous at first though on the wait time, because there was a line out the door for ordering to-go or to eat in the main dining hall.  Since the bro was familiar with the place and knows just about everyone in slo, he directed us straight to a bar area where we ate at the counter.  Bartender was there, took our order, got it a few moments later.  Excellent service."
253,5,"Tried out Tarikh's (of Static Noyze) class (Saturdays at 4) and it was BEYOND AMAZING. He did a collaboration combo with Goose (also of Static Noyze/ABDC Static Noyze6) and it rocked. Absolutely rocked. I've been looking for a hip hop class in Boston of this caliber for a while now. It was a good mixture of hard-hitting and attitude-infused hip-hop. My fave. Please. If you are looking to get it HARD, try his class out. He also teaches once in a while (SN company members take turns each week) at Jeannette Neill right by the Garden on Thursdays. TRY HIS CLASS OUT!

Downside to Green Street is that it's a bit hard to locate (no big flashing neon signs) and the studios are very plain. White walls and mirrors only on one wall. Enough to get a class going but not as tricked out as most studios."
254,5,"I don't get why this place is getting 2 or 3 stars...this place is fantastic!!

Red velvet = heaven. When I'm having a rough day,  a glass of wine and a cupcake is all i need for dinner :)

Raspberry Cheescake, delish. Cappucino, delish. Lemon drop, YUM!  Regular vanilla, carrot cake, blueberry, double chocolate... the list goes on and on, I would be happy with any flavor. Well... cept bubblebum, but thats a personal thing i dont like bubble gum flavor anything.


If you go right before closing time,  you won't have much to choose from. They aren't stale or anything, you just will have one or two flavors to choose from. 

Everyone who works there is always super happy and nice! I've had zero complications when I call in an order for birthdays or special occasions. 

And my favorite part.... they jUST stick to cupcakes. That's it. Not egg sandwichs or pies or pressed panini's....just cupcakes. 

My kinda place."
255,1,"I wish I knew how to quit you.  Cafe Mattina, Cafe Intermezzo -- which ever way you choose to swing, we could have had a real good life together.  Now all we have is Brokeback Mountain.

I put up with all of your shenanigans.  Cash only?  Sure, I'll just go to the ATM.  Less than clean tables? It's okay, I'll wipe down my own.  Raising your prices 50 cents across the board?  Fine, I'll go get more money from the ATM. 

Remember that time when you forgot my order and gave me chicken salad instead of tuna salad?  Common misunderstanding.  Chicken... Chicken of the Sea... Jessica got a little confused on that one too.  I forgave you.  I even laugh about that one now. 

Or those cucumbers that looked more like rubber because you left them out for too long.  Those were good times. 

I didn't even make a peep when you thought I was getting fat and started slicing my honey wheat bread a little smaller.  You didn't say it, but I know that's what you meant. 

I mean I loved you.  Your salads were just -- well I'll be honest, just so well-endowed.  And I mean it's not like I really had to pay much for them either. 

But our last date?  That was just too far.  I stood in line for you for 20 minutes.  It was cold.  It was raining.  I was outside.  But I loved you even then.  I ordered my usual, the half BLTA and half salad with Bleu Cheese.  Remember?  I was so happy seeing that fresh bread being sliced, that thick spread of mustard.

Oh wait.  Who are you?  What are you doing here?  Mouse?  Cafe Mattina, have you been cheating on me with a mouse?  Don't lie, I saw her scamper across my open-faced sandwich, stark naked.  That floozy!  How dare you!  We were involved! 

How am I even to look at you?  We're through.  I'm done.  I don't want to ever see you again.  Ever."
256,5,"My mother introduced me to this place about a year ago and I'm SO glad she did. They have the best pizza in Harvard Square and is probably in my top 5 favorite pizza places ever. It's literally tucked away in an alley... no wonder I had never noticed it before! I'm pretty sure they've been there forever because my mom said her and my dad frequented it when they were dating - ahhh young love.

The food is inexpensive and the service is wonderful! There is always a line but it moves wicked fast. I usually stop in when I'm in Harvard which unfortunately is becoming less and less since moving to the black hole that is JP :("
257,5,"130? Little drunk? Hankering for a nom nom? Gyro's is just about as good as it gets. Lamb and beef combo all day, everyday. They take card here (but charge 50 cents) while the other one doesn't and I think this one tastes way better. When I'm starving, Gyros is literally my default."
258,5,"How have I gone this long without writing a review for Cat's Cradle???

I have so many great memories of time spent at this amazing concert venue nestled in Carrboro.  The venue is the perfect size, in my opinion.  It's small enough that there's not a bad ""seat"" in the house.  It's large enough to get a really good crowd going.  

The layout of the club is great, with a merch area off to the side, seating around the perimeter and at the back, and the bar and restrooms in a separate room at the back of the club.  There's plenty of standing room near the stage.  Lighting and sound are great.  

Cat's Cradle hosts a great variety of good quality bands.  They offer local and bottled brew at reasonable prices.  I wish they accepted credit cards at the bar, but there is an atm available. 

Parking can be a bit sticky but is better now that Visart has closed.

Keep an eye out for your favorite band and make sure to check it out!!"
259,4,"Really good deal for food. The cali-style burrito and the frankenstein have been my favorites. The burritos are really big. It isn't the best looking place to eat- lot of homeless dudes hassling you, really small benches and tables."
260,4,"I was visiting my best friend in Boston and she recommended we check this place out. All I have to say is AMAZING!! Mr. Bartley's has the best burgers and onion rings ever. I had the Jersey Shore burger and it hit the spot! I only wished I had a chocolate frappe...next time for sure! 

The only reason for the 4 star is because they don't have a bathroom!!! What restaurant doesn't have a bathroom?? 

A MUST try if you're visiting Harvard Square!"
261,3,"During midterms and finals seasons, I spend a lot of time studying at Moffitt and Doe, so I occasionally drop by FSM for a quick bite to eat. It's almost impossible to find a seat inside since those tables are always in high demand, but if it's a nice day, I don't mind sitting outside (although there are only a few outlets). I usually order the California sandwich on foccacia (cucumber, tomato, avocado, onions, greens, and some zesty mayo), which comes with a side salad if you eat in but not if you take it to go. The sandwich is delicious and the sauce is good (this is coming from someone who doesn't even like mayo). However, they tend to put too much dressing on the salad most of the time. I've literally had my salad drowning in dressing before, so I just tried to scrape as much as I could off...

There's nothing too special about their coffee, but I do like their chai latte since the spices are yummy. If you're feeling something sweet, get the apple cloud!! It's kind of a hybrid between an apple pie pastry and cheesecake! It's pretty dense, so it'd be perfect if you shared with someone, but I have been known to finish the whole thing myself before!

TIP: Try to avoid coming during the lunch rush since the line can extend from the counter to the Moffitt lobby desk..eek! Also, $5 minimum for card!"
262,5,"I can't think of a better listening room in the greater Boston area, if anywhere!  Night in and night out, if you need a fix of some of the best real *music* around, Passim is the place to be.  Period.  

I've seen probably 30-40 shows at Passim, and there's no venue more intimate, no sound system more finely-tuned for its purpose.  One evening of Passim talent beats a month of anything on radio.  Yes, this place gets packed, but that's really part of the charm ... you're never more than a few feet from the action ... and there's usually a darn good reason that all of those people are there to hear the same person or group you are!

I'm actually sorry & surprised that anyone has  had a negative experience here, or found the sound to be lacking (or overpowering).  I'm constantly impressed by Matt's abilities at the board, and I don't think I've ever felt overpowered.

Perhaps it's just me, but I'd rather spend $10-$30 to hear a truly talented musician at Passim than $50-$100 to hear a washed-up has-been in an arena any day of the week!!"
263,3,"This place has great potential.  They were clearly unprepared for the Groupon onslaught.  We went the Saturday night after the Groupon was offered on the previous Thursday.  We made reservations for 8:45 pm but did not need them.

After we sat the apologetic server explained that they were out of quite a few things on the menu... like half the menu (no seriously half!).  Clearly management had no idea what they were in for with the groupon.

Everything is very reasonably priced, I was planning to have the seoul burger but they were out, my second choice (bahn mi) was also gone.  Ended up with the chicken, which had nice sides but was cooler than I like (my dining partner's fall flatbread was piping hot... a bit too sweet for my taste).  Chicken needed salt, none on the table which is fine if food is perfectly seasoned... but risky move if not.  Was a touch dry, wish I went for the steak instead, it looked good at the table next to us.

They totally forgot to bring us our appetizer (fried pickles) but came after the meal with appropriate mea culpa. A more experienced restaurant would comp the mistake.  The fried pickles were awesome, though!  especially the pickled cucumber, the carrot and onion did not pick up the vinegar flavor as well as the cucumber.

Dessert was ""coffee and donuts"" delicious fried dough, the chocolate/ coffee mousse had sea salt on top (a bit too much... wish I had it for my chicken!) but a nice end to the meal.

The ambiance was fun and eclectic, vintage video games, photo booth, we stuck around for the DJ and to dance a bit.  The DJ was a bit monotonous for our tastes but the varied crowd was enjoying.


Despite only 3 stars, I think they have a potential to be 4 or even 5, but will need to get the kinks ironed out. Definitely a welcome addition to Kendall square area.

Looking forward to returning to see if they improve!"
264,4,The food was delicious ( i got the lamb bolognese) but the service was a bit slow
265,5,I've been going to this studio since it opened and it's my favorite in San Diego.  It's not TOO hot and gives you a great workout.  It's brand new and clean...which is a big deal if you're been to other hot studios.  I love the classes and they're always offering great deals on their pricing.  It makes it very affordable.  The music is current and fun and I love the instructors.  I've recommended it to numerous friends and they love it too.  You can't beat this studio!
266,4,"When I heard of the new sushi restaurant in Dobie Mall, I was expecting it to be dingy and unpleasant. I try to avoid Dobie whenever possible except for the occasional Hoa Hoa or Oma's Kitchen. Thankfully the happy hour sign caught my eye, so I gave it a shot. First of all, the service (aka the  cashier/waitress) is as attentive and friendly as it gets. My boyfriend and I literally stood and contemplated what to order for a good fifteen minutes, but she was patient and offered us helpful suggestions, all the while smiling cheerfully. 

Their happy hour menu is decent, and they offer a sprinkling of different and unique rolls as all the basics. We shared an unagi bento box and sushi (Longhorn, avocado, and volcano rolls). The bento box seemed a bit scant, so don't expect a huge, filling meal out of it, but the unagi was perfect. I also appreciated the unique little touches, especially chocolate-covered oranges for dessert. I was impressed with the sushi. Our waitress highly recommended the volcano and Longhorn rolls and she was right on target. The Longhorn roll came out piping hot and it was, dare I say, even better than Kyoto's. The volcano rolls were topped with spicy salmon (but you can choose between salmon, crab and tuna), and they were also great.

Overall, it's one of the cheaper sushi joints out there and the food/service was solid, which means I will have to venture to Dobie more often from now on."
267,2,"Not too bad, not too good either. Like many of the restaurants on the Ave, Costas is just there. The food was middling to average, certainly nothing to write home about. The saganaki (brandied cheese set on fire) that we ordered was delicious, but it's hard to get fried cheese wrong. My spanakopita wasn't so great though...it had a weird hint of spearmint that I've never experienced before in that dish. Usually it's feta cheese/onions/spinach?  To top it all off, there was one waitress working the entire floor on a Friday night, and she forgot to bring us our check for at least a half an hour. I guess we might come here again if we were feeling really lazy, but there's other Greek restaurants in town that we have yet to try."
268,5,"Yeah, okay, five stars. I adore this place. It's my go-to pho spot when I want something fancier than Than Bros. Their veg pho is amazing - so flavorful, piping hot and full to the brim of veggies. I also love the wonton noodle soup, not least because the wontons look like little brains. The bahn mi is tasty as well, and a steal at something like $3.change.

The employees/owners are wonderful. They always call you sister (or brother if you're, you know, a dude) and are genuinely warm and pleasant every time I have gone in there. Nothing hits the spot on a cold rainy Seattle day like a visit here, for my belly and my soul."
269,1,"The Hong Kong's sole redeeming quality is that it's the only venue in the Harvard sq area that's big enough to accomodate big groups without reservations, although why you would want to throw an event here is beyond me. The drinks are overpriced, the service is needlessly aloof and rude, the music & DJs are mediocre at best, and the crowd leans heavily toward the just-turned-21 vibe. The bouncers are dangerously volatile; I know several people who went outside well before closing to make a phone call or smoke etc and were denied re-entry and in some cases physically assaulted when they tried to get back inside to their friends & drinks. This even happened when someone specifically asked and was told they could get back in after their phone call. Stay away from this place."
270,5,Great vegan and vegetarian options. Delectable. Fabulous wine list and great view windows in bar. Come here every time we're in SLO.

The food is absolutely delicious.  The menu is vegetarian friendly.  The cozy dining area has a wonderful atmosphere, with beautiful artwork and decorations.  This is as good as it gets.

PS:  Plan ahead - they only accept cash.  Also, no alcohol."
272,4,"I am in town with one of my kids who is going to a camp at the University here. We have had the trip from hell. Twenty eight hours to get from SFO to Providence, arrived with lost luggage and nothing to wear. We checked in at 4 am. It was a nightmare. 

Enter the staff. They have been AMAZING. They upgraded us to a larger room. When my daughter's luggage still wasn't here they gave me sheets and towels for her dorm room. The bell guy Brandon spent at least 30 or 40 minutes on the phone with United helping track down my luggage. The front desk women (Caitlyn and one other whose name I don't know!!)  spent time on the phone with my husband and made sure that our luggage actually got delivered while  I was delivering the sheets etc to my daughter. The staff here has gone above and beyond in helping us. 

The Biltmore is an old hotel. It's got some scars and bits and pieces are a little worn BUT that is part of it's charm. The beds are super comfy. The shower has great pressure. Room service is FAST and efficient. There is a giant walk in closet (that of course I didn't need because I had no luggage). My room is very quiet. I can't hear a thing from the people around me. 

Negatives: The bathroom counter space isn't super big. The in room coffee is Maxwell House (I'm guessing because there is a Starbucks in the lobby). The hallways and elevators are not air conditioned or very lightly and they are pretty hot (rooms are great tho)

If we return to Providence (which I am hoping we will), we will definitely stay here again. They are fabulous. 

I wish Yelp let me give 1/2 stars because I would definitely give 4 1/2!!"
273,1,"This may be a bit of an odd review of the place, because it has little to do with the actual facilities, but I believe it speaks very much to the spirit of the Arts Guild. 

I am a photographer who wanted to provide some gratis headshots for a good friend of mine, and the  gardens attached to the complex seemed like a great place to get some fun photos. I checked online to make sure that it was okay to take photos there, and found that it was. To quote: ""artists and photographers are welcome"" is verbatim what it states on the website. Sounded great to me!  It also mentioned something about registering when I got there.

Sooo... My friend and I arrive, and spend a fair amount of time looking for someplace to register, and then finally give up and start shooting. Sure enough, someone comes up to me and tells me I have to make an appointment to photograph on the grounds (mentioned NOWHERE on their website) and that because I'm a PROFESSIONAL I have to pay a fee in order to shoot there. Mind you, her determination that I was a professional came solely from looking at my equipment. According to her, because I possessed a nice SLR and not a point and shoot, this qualified me to pay some mysterious fee NOT mentioned on their website. (oh yeah, also, I was taking PORTRAITS. I guess if I'd been taking pictures of FLOWERS with my super-nice camera, I would not have been considered a professional...???) The fee was so mysterious, she did not even know how much it was, but she guessed it was somewhere around $50. When I attempted to explain to her that I was making no money on my ""portrait"" shoot, she stated that the guild ""had to make money somehow."" She proceeded to harass me and my friend, even though I assured her that I had, in good faith, checked out the website to see if there where shooting restrictions prior to my arrival.

So here's what I find so crazy - why am I being charged money simply because I own a nice camera? And why are the fees mentioned nowhere on the website?  Had I known about these fees, I would not have wasted my time, or my friends time in driving over to the guild in the first place. I would have instead gone to any one of a number of other local park areas that do not charge discriminatory fees to individuals who own good camera equipment.

Bottom line: The Allied Arts Guild has a very sneaky approach to dealing with their potential consumer public, and, if my run-in with their staff is indicative of the norm, they have a beligerant and uninformed volunteer staff that clearly knows nothing about good customer relations. I suspect this attitude applies across the board - I would never recommend a friend  to go there and check out their rental facilities, because they don't have a very professional attitude.

And hey, if the place is supposed to be supporting the arts, why are they making it so hard for someone like me to pursue my art? Oh, I forgot, my camera is too nice..."
274,4,Went on a thursday night and it was delightful.  Had a glass of pinot noir at the bar and it was delicious. the bartender was very friendly. Then sat down for dinner and shared three small plates with a friend and they were all great.  Our server couldn't have been better.  I will absolutely be going back.
275,4,This is one of my favorite restaurants-EVER. The food and drink selection is superb. The service is consistent. The happy hour is also great & very reasonably priced for the quality of food & cocktails!
276,4,"Want a toasted sub filled with fried favorites?  Fat Sal's is your destination.  I had a fat sal which combines the roast beef with...wait for it...onion rings, mozarella sticks, fries, and gravy.  seriously.  it may sound crazy, but man it tastes great.

Their fat fries are great as well with offerings including philly cheese steak fries, pepperoni pizza fries, and buffalo chicken fries, which I got.  I expected mozzarella cheese with some buffalo sauce but they threw in pieces of fried chicken strips as well which really put it over the top.

If you're in the mood for a large greasy meal, Fat Sal's is the place for you."
277,1,Very overpriced. Empanadas took forever to come out even though there were three people working and it's not like they were making them fresh or anything. Empanadas were small and didn't taste good either. Won't go back.
278,3,"Firstly, delicious food. My boyfriend got decatant scallops and I had the artichoke ravioli. Taste and presentation, superb.... price, extremely high. Grafton Street is like fine dining meets London Pub. Ambiance nice, servers amiable. Drink selection and taste.... like the supermarket on a Sunday night... out of stock and listless. Do not order any drink with Ginger beer unless you want ginger on the rocks with a splash of cocktail.

Definitely check it out, but bring your credit card... you are going to need it."
279,4,"I like Peet's because I feel like they're less pretentious than Starbucks... they've got the coupon thing goin' on, and they've had the free wifi thing going for them too, unlike *ahem* some people. 

One of the best things about coffee places is their ability to satisfy my lust for hot, creamy drinks in the wintertime...  Winter is about getting fat with comfort foods and drinks, and where better to do that than at Peet's, where you can get something with way too many calories than you should be drinking, yet it's so delicious you don't care, until you step on the scale the next day."
280,5,"So we all know the bent spoon has incredible ice cream, but little did I know their cupcakes are just as good. The flavors are limited but, delicious all the same."
281,5,"I love California Cafe. I went there with my husband for a date night. The hostess was very polite. We ordered the appetizer trio with a crab cake, coconut shrimp, and boar ribs. The sauce on the ribs was excellent, and the coconut shrimp were perfectly cooked. I liked the crabcake as well.
Next my husband had the butternut squash soup (tasty) and I had a beet salad. It was the best salad I've had in a long time. The dressing was very light and the greens were exquisite in variety and taste. For our meals we had scallops with wild mushroom rissotto and lamb rack with horseradish mashed potatoes and roasted beets and greens. They were excellently prepared and presented, and were a delight to partake of. Nom Nom Nom

For dessert we had carrot cake that was so moist and delishious it was hard to stop myself from fiendishly stuffing it in my face.  My hubby had a chocolate bread pudding that wad very nice, but I preferred my carroty goodness. I also had some cafe and we tried some dessert wine that I can not remember the name of, but it was pleasant and not too sweet. We were quite satisified, and will be back again."
282,2,"The eggplant dish they served during their buffet was 5 stars, but everything else was just oily and unappetizing. The staff was very pleasant though, and even one of their customers was helpful in directing me (yes, I judge a place based on it's regulars). It was real close to three stars, but paying over $10 for a lunch buffet (not counting tip) is just a no-no in my book, especially when the majority of the food is so bad."
283,4,"Outdoor seating makes this a great lunch spot on a nice warm afternoon. They even have heat lamps for chilly nights. The Harris Ranch Cheeseburger was satisfying and much too large to finish, especially with the herb fries that accompany the burger. I was tempted to order one of their yummy drinks on the menu, but decided to go with the iced tea. Overall, great atmosphere and average food but the prices were a little on the expensive side."
284,4,"This was the first place I've been to when I got into Berkeley. Compared to C U Sushi and Tako Sushi, this is EXPENSIVE to a college student. It's a cute little house with patio seating. They do offer more variety in sushi and rolls and not bad quality either, just your typical traditional Japanese restaurant menu. This was before they revamp the place, changed the menu.

Four years later, I came back here again. I had this feeling of this place has turned into Japanese fusion. Not a bad thing, just that I don't truly enjoy the fusion in sushi rolls. I always felt like it's a way to cover up the lack of quality in sashimi grade fish. So I didn't really try their rolls at all.

Anyway, I really enjoy their jalapeno pork belly soba. I'm not a big fan of soba just because of this weird aftertaste from the noodles, but I'm a big fan of pork belly. There's so much flavor in pork belly, and luckily that covered the weird soba taste I disliked. The noodles are not drenched in sauce, so it's not overly soggy or anything. It's kinda hard to make soba soggy anyway. It's a simple, lightly flavored dish, very filling. 

I think I liked this place after it has changed its menu. The fusion does work after all! Well, just on the entrees side. I'll decide if I want to give into the rolls. 

Lastly, if you're a beer drinker, do get this one beer called Echigo Red Ale. I haven't seen it in stores like at Bevmo or other places. This beer is so light and aromatic, it's a must try!"
285,4,"I was in search of a good breakfast, while waiting for a matinee, when I stumbled upon Sebastians Cafe. I'll be honest- the pictures of crepes drew me in, although I didn't intend to order one. The restaurant had a lot of food choices, many of the lunch choices look delicious, but I was way too early to try those. I settled on a breakfast sandwich wrap and the yummiest muffin that I have ever tasted- orange flavor with chunks of chocolate. Heavenly!

The place was spacious, with wifi and a television. It wasn't crowded when I went at all. The service was fast, and the cashier was very helpful as I pointed at various muffins and asked what kind. I did see another customer who wanted a crepe and he was told none were available. That was slightly misleading, but my muffin was so good that I didn't really care about that!

Prices were a little more than I expected to pay, but I assume it's based on the location. To me, everything in Cambridge always seems just a bit more than I would normally pay. If I find myself in that area again, and am craving a muffin or am in time for lunch, I would definitely visit again."
286,5,"I have been shopping at Weaving Works since before they moved into their swanky ( well, swanky in a knitting kind of way) space.  They have an amazing selection of fibres and  yarns.  Also extraordinary buttons and spinning supplies.

They only place in town to buy needles and fibre for felting."
287,5,"Our lovely dog Wasabi was in terrible need of some TLC from being an outdoor dog for almost a year. A small Maltese, our dog looked more like a lion before we brought them to Wenchi and Erin. They transformed our dog from a mini lion back to a beautiful dog.

I called at little after noon and although they said they were pretty booked, Wenchi fit my dog in within a few hours. Our dog got the works done and for what they did, you can't beat their prices! Both Wenchi and Erin are awesome and you can tell that they truly have a passion and love in what they do. Their pleasant personalities completely won both me and Wasabi over!

They'll be seeing Wasabi again in another six weeks. We wouldn't imagine going anywhere else."
288,4,"Love it. Its fun and tasty! U get to create ur own burger and the environment is great. 

4 stars cuz the service sux."
289,2,"Went to Efes with 5 others last night and while the food was good the service was horrible.  It took forever to get wine glasses and water.  Our water was never refilled, the wine opener was taken away and never brought back so we could open additional bottles (despite our asking for it twice).  We ordered a few apps that required bread, they came out and then, after we asked for it, one basket of bread came out.  We had to ask several times for more bread.  

Everyone enjoyed their food but I can't say I'd go back again due to how bad the service was.  One person in our group made the comment that he'd been there before for takeout and had waited nearly 45 minutes.  

Yet another bad restaurant in Princeton, this area could do so much better."
290,5,"Coffee is something I can't live without, and this Peet's location is my favorite. It is near my gym and the overall vibe is much more pleasant than the one on Foothill.  

I'll usually order the hot coffees like an extra-shot latte or espresso, but yesterday I ordered one of their cold blended coffees with vanilla syrup and whipped cream. It was so rich and satisfying! I was so glad I got a great workout in beforehand and could afford the added calories.

For some reason this location makes me happy, even when I'm moping and having a shitty day. It's just so aesthetically pleasing around here.

I also love the barista here - a tall white boy with a terrific fro and messy wannabe beard. He's very quick and precise and easy-going... I love slobs."
291,5,"I just like the fresh flavor.  I am vegetarian so I cannot comment on the meat but the veggies are always fresh.  Their guacamole is consistently awesome and has a great flavor.  I've had their small burritos which are plenty filling but the large is awesome too!  

This place gets a thumbs up for fast service, consistent fresh quality, and for always being there."
292,5,"I decided to come here on a whim after the party I was attending got busted. Right when I walked in I felt like I was in a cordial, welcoming atmosphere. The bartenders and servers are great, they do an awesome job of preparing your drinks and food in a timely manner and they provide excellent service. It's like they want you to be there and have a good time. Nine Irish Brothers is a nice change of pace from the other Purdue bars in that there isn't an overabundance of sorostitutes or douchebags, but rather a nice mix of people old and young, students and townies, etc. And I really do feel like I'm in a genuine Irish pub when I'm there. All of the decorations are authentic, straight out of Ireland, and they have live music on Fridays. I heart Nine Irish Brothers! :)"
293,5,"Their Gelato is really good, but I'm not expert in this field. They have some crazy flavors that are pretty out there while still having some conventional flavors (taro,chocolate) their crazy flavors are pretty good. You can also sample to your hearts content as well. The portions though are RIDICULOUS, VERY VERY GENEROUS GOT THE MINI AND WAS LIKE WTF THIS IS TOO MUCH.   It seems like a family business which I like a lot. The atmosphere is nice similar to your typical frozen yogurt shop and they provide some games ( Jenga, a deck of cards and dominoes)."
294,5,Absolutely delicious food that is reasonably priced and HEALTHY.  I recomend the venetian veggie and their fries.  Next time you are in a health-streak check this place out.
295,1,"Sigh.  So I went back and thought, hey, maybe all they need is a second chance!  Well that sort of optimistic thinking resulted in another nice garment absolutely ruined.  Here's the funny part (well, I'm not laughing): I turned it in without any stains, and my dry cleaning order got held up because they had created a nice pink smudge all across the beige collar of this jacket.  They asked me to come back that same day and when I did...wow, the garment was not done.  It's amazing that they put your contact phone number on the receipt, yet fail to warn you before you make the hike up there.

But I digress...they insisted on charging me full price for the dry cleaning (and no discount, even though they took longer and created a nice new fat stain) and even when I returned ...the garment looked REMARKABLY smaller.  Cleaning 101:  Wool should never be washed and dried.  Oh, and don't tell the customer you didn't wash it.  It is painfully obvious when wool is washed and dried.

The jacket had magically shrunk to leprechaun size, but oh look the pink stain we created is gone!  It was a gorgeous jacket and purchased overseas.  Of course there is no receipt for such a purchase, even though they offered to pay me for the garment.  Instead, it would have been nice to credit back my dry cleaning bill in its entirety, but no, that's asking too much customer service.

Here's another odd part.  They took the jacket.  Why? To ship it off to dry-cleaning institution somewhere.  

So to recap, I turned in a nice relatively clean beige wool jacket, made several trips back to see whether they had removed their pink stain, paid full price, and then was given a shrunken obviously-washed jacket, which they promptly took back.  Oh, but upon demand I was given my $8 back for the dry cleaning of that jacket.

EcoClean, your customer service, or lack thereof, is really disappointing.  You obviously are not concerned about losing customers.  Perhaps it is time for another eco-friendly dry cleaner in town."
296,3,"For every type of restaurant you need a baseline to judge the restaurant's compatability with one's palate.

I judge every breakfast/brunch establishment by their french toast.
Thick cut slices topped with strawberries. Very standard, then again now I'm asking how could one even make french toast better.

My date's hash and eggs looked and tasted like the better option. (Though I wasn't about to admit it at the time, I'll definitely have to go savory the next time I frequent Mayfield.)"
297,1,"Just awful. Two words to encapsulate my very brief experience here. I came in on a weekday morning about 7:45am. They were not busy at all, with six tables open in the front portion of the dining room and nobody sitting outside. I asked to sit outside, was given a menu by the host who looked like he would rather be somewhere else, and who told me that someone would take my order shortly. I sat at a table outside in full view of the host and no wait staff ever came to my table. I didn't even have anything to drink. After 15 minutes I decided that they simply don't care. I will never come here again."
298,1,"Nothing beats a combination of over-crowding, a bunch of med students and rice grads too stuck on themselves, and a blend of over pricing when it comes to ruining a great beer selection.

Broken from the mold of generic bars that all look like The Ginger Men across the country, this place is not only far from unique, parking sucks and the pricing is such that it is more economical to drive to College Station, Texas, and drink at O'Bannons Taphouse where the selection is the same and the drafts are priced about half of that at Ginger Men with the same selection.

Their knowledge is great, and I will be the first one to say they have a great selection, but let's be real - large crowds are crappy because the larger the crowd, the worse the place is for service.  So, who cares?  Double the no caring for the fact the place is populated by a bunch of wanna-be alcohol beverage experts.  Sit your grad student hiney down and go hit the local mini-mart and let the professional drinkers explain things to you.  

Sadly, the crowd that populates this place is the type that is irritating to listen to and be around - self-serving hippies and people who think they are better than everyone overcrwoding a place that should be specifically a haunt for those who truly love spirits of all types - including beers.  Instead, a bunch of trust fund babies and over-snooty liberals ruin an otherwise great experience.

Did I mention the horrible parking situation?  Add that in for the irritation factor, and it is just one more notch against what should be a fun experience.  

So, in the end, if you dig over priced drinks, bad parking, over crowding, people attempting to be cooler than they are, then this is YOUR place and YOU deserve to go there and enjoy it. 

Otherwise, this place makes the bar at Houston's look like a better alternative."
299,5,"Bacaro Burger w/Egg = I just went to heaven.

They have Chimay on tap. Is it possible to go to heaven twice?"
300,3,"Steamhouse Lounge... 

HAPPY HOUR: Hush puppies were really good. Nice and hot with butter on them....yummy! Baked Oysters were really good...some spicy flavors....my favorite. We ordered some mussels but they smelled horrible. So fishy and even tasted fishy. We were told they were fresh mussels...ummm...rrright. I had a bowl of their infamous lobster bisque. The bisque had chunky lobster pieces..first time i have had a lobster bisque like this and it was very good. Service was not okay. 

SECOND TIME (late night): They have $16.00 bottle of wines. And the wines taste good. AND did i mention they are $16.00 per bottle?!!! Service was great this night. 

Overall food is okay. The decor, ambiance and $16.00 bottles of wine makes this place a fun place to hang out."
301,2,"Ice cream is definitely very good. Very creamy, rich, and flavorful. 

However, I'm not sure if the price (4.25 for a scoop) makes the ice cream worthwhile. They also charged an extra free because I put my two scoops in two separate containers. Seriously?

Good ice cream, but very pricey. Service can also be a hit or a miss."
302,5,"This place is awesome.  College + Friends + Wings + Beer = Good times.  

Ever since I graduated and moved to the west coast, I have been fantasizing about the giant, oversized wings they have here.  In California, we have apparently reversed our poultry knowledge so that the wings become super super small.  But not so at Wings Over Ithaca, where the wings are generously sized and flavored in a variety of well, flavors.  

They also have wings eating contests.  I've spectated but never participated.  

I went back over reunion and this place was just as good as I remembered."
303,5,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again. I don't like pizza. But apparently the metro area has a lot of good pizza, starting with the original Ledo. Wow. Perfect little squares of cheese and pepperoni hot out of the oven and ripe with goodness. There's not a lot of crust because most of the pieces are middle pieces. I would usually applaud this, but I really enjoyed the crust. So much so that I sought out the outside pieces. 

I can tell you I was still eating leftovers 3 days later and they were continuously excellent."
304,1,"Where do i begin? It doesn't matter how cold it is outside, Rick's is always right around body temperature (98.7 degrees) and smells like someone dumped too much chlorine into a pool.... don't ask me there's no pool in Rick's? 

If you like to listen to top 20 music, Lil Wayne, and other garbage music, have a Jersey Shore haircut, like to wear button-up dress shirts with the top 4 buttons undone, (chest hair optional) douse yourself in cologne, and grind on ""Bitches & Hoe's"" this place is for you! 

Make the Gotti brothers proud and show off your orange skin at Rick's in downtown Ann Arbor!"
305,2,"Once again, I am letdown by a highly rated restaurant without the food to substantiate the claims.

I am going to have to preface every review the same!: I came here on a Saturday late afternoon (5:30PM ish), so maybe I just had a rare experience and caught Samir's at an off-time...(For the record, I don't know Samir, but I don't think he was working--just a woman and a teenage boy who appeared to be related.)

On to the food...

We started with a hummus appetizer, which my girlfriend and her sister really liked, but I thought was just so-so. Unfortunately, the pita bread was kind of stale, and that's a disappointment; it's one of a few ingredients in a really simple dish, so every bit counts. On the plus side, the olive oil was definitely flavorful.

For dinner, I had the falafel plate, my girlfriend had a chicken plate, and her sister had a chicken gyro.

Perhaps, for the first time in my life, I can't say that the falafel was bland--but ""salty"" isn't what I was really looking for. Overall, the falafel was decently crisp on the outside and moist on the inside, which is the right balance. If it wasn't for the spicing, these could have been quite good.

My girlfriend's chicken was moist, but just wasn't anything special. Not bad, but not great.

I didn't try the chicken gyro, but the feedback was similar to the chicken plate--not bad, but not great.

Since this was my girlfriend's sister's last meal in Seattle, we decided to do things properly by ordering baklava and Turkish coffee. Since I'm a sweet fan, if a dessert is sweet, I can't call it bad. But the baklava, honestly, was almost bad. A good baklava should have light, crispy phyllo--I honestly couldn't cut Samir's version, no matter how hard I pressed down. In order to break it apart into edible pieces, I had to use my teeth. It was as if the sugar liquid had thoroughly soaked all the phyllo and been allowed time to set. Again, it was sweet, and the flavor was definitely close to what it should be, but those qualities can't overpower the problems.

Would I eat at Samir's again? Well, given the price, it's not like I would avoid this place like the plague--you aren't going to miss a mortgage payment if you stop by for a full dinner. That being said, I would definitely try many other places before coming back."
306,3,"potatoes:  yesss.
omelet with spinach:  decent. wet from spinach.
cheese grits:  i love grits. i love cheese. i love grits with cheese.
biscuits:  bad. dry. heavy.
decor:  cuuuuute.
service:  very good."
307,5,Great place to do business! They absolutely work with you so that your finished product is beautifully done:) Highly recommend them.
308,2,"We ate here because of the yelpers reviews and the homemade pasta...big mistake. the homemade pasta was so-so but it was covered in tasteless tomato sauce with a giant, dry, tasteless meatball (which, btw isn't Italian at all but Italian American, and descended from southern italy, though they claim northern italian heritage). the staff was friendly if a bit slow (which wouldn't have mattered if the food had been good). the seafood pasta was also bad. I would not recomend this place to others. The heart is in the right place, decent tomatoes, homemade pasta, but the execution is way off the mark."
309,5,"Mmmmm.. those were some really good hotdogs.. i like the bun sooo much.. not your typical hot dog bun...
i got the frankfurter (?), something with 50% veal, pork, and something else.. who knows.. lol     i put onions, sauerkraut, and ketchup on it and it was fantastic!
i would definitely come here again and try other kinds"
310,2,"Sigh.  When a friend of mine wanted to come here, I had never tried this place, and decided to give it a shot.  On a friday night.

30+ Minute wait to be seated, when the restaurant wasn't quite full.

10+ Minute wait to have a server find us and get a drink order after we were seated.

Staff were not at all attentive.  In fact, despite repeated attempts to make eye contact with *anyone* nobody seemed to catch it, including the two managers who were running around with earpieces on.

The appetizer I got was a seared tuna special.  The whole point of seared tuna is to cook it minimally to preserve the basic flavor it has.  Chang's (note this is a Japanese dish at a Chinese [themed] restaurant) was overcrusted in their rub, and then drowned in sauce.

The orange beef I got came out overcooked and mostly flavorless, lumped together on a plate with no garnish or anything else.

Another 20+ minute wait to get our check and get out of there.

PS, overpriced.  Not worth the price of admission.

Corporate food at its worst.  We should have just gone to someplace authentic like Jing Jing in downtown PA."
311,3,"Just happened to stumble across this place. Glad we did. 

Atmosphere was pleasant and friendly; you get a view of the woodfired oven....at least I think that's what it was. Either way, the outdoor sitting is pretty good as you can people watch as you dine.

The bread roll that they give you is amazing....bread was fresh and piping hot!!

I had the B & B (burger and beer) special. Burger was done perfectly (medium rare) and beer was a local brew, so it was a refreshing lunch. Fiance had the grilled chicken sammy on Italian roll. Both meals were tasty. Curly fries were lacking as they didnt seem to be fried enough....I like mine crispy.

Overall, good service and good food."
312,2,"I used to come here fairly often when I descended into a shameful spiral of coffee addiction. Burnt beans provided longer fixes and free wi-fi produced the perfect front for my wasteful ways. Then I wisened up, moved on and saw Espresso Royale for what it is...well, it was actually leaving Ann Arbor for summer that got me my relatively caffeine-free life again.

The coffee here has gotten really bad lately. Maybe it's the barbarian in the back who roasts the beans. If you see a bald asshole emerging from the backroom, say hello for me. He pulled out in front of me on State Street in an ugly white sedan when I was walking during a walk sign and then wagged his finger at me. Of course he walked to the back of Espresso Royale when I was waiting in line. I left a nice note in the tip jar for him.

I'm writing a boring paper on clinical psychology and this is not a case of displaced anger. I'm really not as bitter as Espresso Royale coffee! I had stopped buying coffee from here altogether in the last year. The espresso beans either taste stale or scorched, depending on the day. The iced lattes are absolutely tasteless even with loads of sweetener and the pastries are overpriced and uninspired. 

I guess if you want to do a sociological study on the masses of hipsters that are spending money on lattes that they should have been putting into savings to avoid complete future penury, Espresso Royale is the place. Oh wait, hipsters only look poor. By the way, I'm only kidding about saying hi to the scary bald man at Espresso Royale!"
313,1,i checked in to a gas station must have been drunk lol
314,3,I bit cheaper then most theaters but offers all the same movies and snacks as any of the others with a bit of that 'time gone by feel'
315,1,"Congratulations, Cinco De Mayo! You have preserved the 1980s Mexican restaurant experience well into the next millenium! 

Loud music, kitschy decorations, and loads of extremely greasy but minimally flavored food. If you are over 30, you can relive your childhood Mexican restaurant experiences here.

I was surprised that my Arroz Pollo came literally soaked in melted cheese, then covered with about 1/2 cup of sour cream. It did not taste bad, but if you soak food in enough fat, it almost cannot help taste decent. It was very heavy and overall unpleasant to eat.

The two children's meals I ordered were significantly worse - my guess is that they were frozen dinners reheated, because even the rice was unpalatable.

But perhaps there are other items on the menu that are better. And I will say that the service was nice and helpful."
316,2,"Ok.  What's up with the service?

I was excited to try this place out, but after this experience I'm not sure I'll be going back.  

Service Faux Pas:

1. Waited 25 minutes for someone to take our order when we were clearly ready.  It seemed they only had one server but he could of let us know that he will get to us eventually.

2. Waited another 20 minutes for food to arrive.  It was pretty good (more on it later).

3. It was impossible to get someone to come over for anything!  At one point we needed a spoon and it took forever so we just used a spoon that was for the sauce.  

4. Our waiter was pretty much a space cadet.  When he came to get our check, I specifically wrote down on the check how we wanted it to be split PLUS, I told him that we left the note on the check.  He comes back and told us oops, I didn't see it and just split it evenly.  What?!  IT   IS    WRITTEN     ON    THE      CHECK!

Food:  The food was actually pretty good.  We ordered veggie somosas, which were made from spinach and was pretty good, the Chicken Tikka Masala (not really Indian, but delicious anyway), Aloo Chole and Sag Paneer.  All of it came in pretty good portions and the spinach dish was especially tasty.

So if you're patient enough for bad service, then I'd definitely stop by for treats."
317,1,"Will not be back way over priced for such small rooms and the customer service is terrible I am surprised Marriott is usually much better!!! Disappointed!!!!!!
Also our TV was not working and the hotel was having problems throughtout. The pool area could use LOTS of help but I guess it will be going through a renovation. Maybe that is why room rates are so high we are helping fund it?"
318,1,"I agree with Traci K: ""The people at Supercuts do NOT know what they are doing.  That's why they work at Supercuts.""

My hair looked better when I came in rather than when I left. I hate going somewhere feeling ripped off, especially when it comes to my hair. STAY AWAY from the supposed stylist TRACY! 

If you care about your hair AND want to look good, please go find real stylists like at SAY LULA SALON in East Village! I LOVE my hair & will never go back to these cheap ""salons."""
319,3,"Our closest car wash so we use it. Most of the time it is good enough. About 1 out of 4 washes they do a lousy job on either the wheels, the console or the main windshield. And if you're just back from a camping trip with a pretty gnarly vehicle, don't expect much. Good enough for $18."
320,2,"Went there on a recent Monday night and the place was fairly busy.  I saw this as a good sign of my dinner to come.  In a word: NO.  I ordered the chowder and a chicken cobb salad, my favorite.  The chowder was good (not fantastic) but my beef is with the salad.  Much of the romaine was BROWN and WITHERED and the chicken was DRY and OVERCOOKED.  Please note that I am not paying $9 for a dinner salad that isn't teeming with fresh ingredients.  Not here, not anywhere.  I should have mentioned it to the waitress, but I was dining with company and didn't feel like making a scene.  I did however pick out the brown pieces and set them aside on my bread plate.  By this point, my appetite was gone and I just wanted to get the hell out of there.  I did just that and will not be coming back.  Harvard Squaure has too many other *better* dining destinations for me to waste my time at Z Square."
321,3,"They are very professional and competent, and I feel like my eyes are in good hands. I find it a little formal and impersonal, it is such a busy office. At the same time, that they are so busy reflects the quality of their care. They accept most insurance and are easy to work with."
322,1,This place is awful. I'm huge into Pho and was so stoked when this place FINALLY opened across the street from my work. Huge disappointment. I can't even get into how bummed out my meal here made me... but I'll go ahead and save you the awful meal and let you know I'm never going here again. What a joke.
323,3,"If you are in the mood for an inexpensive Pho Phix, then this is your place.  Bring friends because there is something for everyone and they have Boba drinks as well.  The menu has a variety of soups, rice dishes and noodle dishes, all fairly priced and pretty good.

Note: Parking in Westwood can be a hassle."
324,3,"Central Kitchen is okay but that is the extent of its goodness.  They have a grilled chicken salad that is Greek style but with an American twist.  I thought that it was decent but nothing remarkable.  It wasn't cheap either which baffled me because the portion was small.  I do love how they have bottled coca cola.  Tastes better to me for some reason.  Again, it's okay so give it a try if you aren't expecting some scrumptiousness."
325,2,"Clover, you have a niche, healthy and delicious offering.  

Why then, do you constantly disappoint me by mutilating it as you hand it to me?  Cracked eggs, leaky sandwiches, upside down hand-offs (this one really irks me), arguing with the customer saying ""you know, when you squeeze an egg it pops..  you must have been the one to pop it because we never break the yolk"" (by the way, I watch you stab the yolk with a kneif each time).  I've had about a dozen bad experiences like this in the 1-2 or so years I've been going there.

Show a little customer service and a little humility, Clover.  Stop arguing with the customer.  There's just no need for that, ever.  Good food and great service is about care and paying attention to the little things.  Show me that, and you'll have 4 stars.  You've got a lot going for you but you need to pull it together."
326,2,"To be honest, I was unimpressed with Cambridge, 1 after reading many good reviews. First of all, the music was BLASTING. Like, really loud. Like, so loud it was hard to talk to our party. Second of all, the food took quite a while despite us and one other party being the only patrons in the restaurant. And third of all, the food simply wasn't good. 

I had the farfalle ($11 I think) and a tomato basil pizza ($15). The pizza was ""meh"" (which is why I'm giving it two stars: the Yelp description for two stars is ""meh."" The crust was wet and soggy and flopped around like a sad dolphin, and there was an overload of basil on the pizza. Yes, I know it's supposed to have basil on it, but there was just too much.

The cheese was also mediocre, as it lacked a cheesy flavor and tasted mass-produced. However, the sauce was the one bright spot of the meal: it had a nice, rustic flavor and complimented the farfalle quite well. That said, the farfalle was too soft. 

All in all, this is one of the few times that Yelp has ever steered me wrong and I won't be coming back."
327,1,"The food was freshly microwaved and the decor crafted to make an Ann Arbor News restaurant reviewer settle for adjectives like ""hip"", ""urban"", and ""chic"".   The more appropriate adjective would be ""suburban"", as in Novi mall restaurant.  One redeeming factor - $2 14 oz. beers during happy hour.  Given its proximity to campus (and the aforementioned drink specials) this place will quickly morph into Fratlebee's."
328,3,"I'm thankful they are there, it helps to kill time while waiting for a train or shuttle.  

I like their other location better but they make the best of what they have here.  Tried their hot chocolate w/ cardemon, it was interesting.  Their regular coffee needs help."
329,1,"We had a business setting - party of 8. If it was just for the food, I'd give it only 2 stars. But my god, the service was horrendous. Did they only have 1 waiter for the night? It took forever to get the last appetizer. I mean, everyone was done with the previous ones and had much time to rest and digest it. Then the main courses came out. I wasn't too critical of my salmon but on the dry side. The polenta tasted like it was just drown in butter. Then I look at one of the other's steak. Probably only 3.5"" in diameter, and 1/2"" in thickness. All for a ""measely"" $24. It didn't look very appealing to me. That person asked for the bbq sauce when ordering and it didn't come with the meal. He asked again at the beginning of his meal and it came when he only had 2 bites left for a 3.5"" flank steak! I mean, 10-15 mins or so just to get a bbq sauce? That was just unacceptable and ridiculous. 

I don't know who names their deserts but that person should be fired. I'm not quite a sweet tooth but I would not call what look like two resse's buttercups a creme brulee. two little 1"" piece of what seem like frozen chocolate cream over an oreo cookie is not chocolate creme brulee! And the others who ordered a chocolate truffle cake. It looked (or is!) a muffin. Just getting a refill on your drink (non-alcoholic) took forever. I had to slowly sip my water in fear I won't see another refill until another 30 mins! 

The place is a joke. The service is a joke. And tacking on a 19% party fee over very poor service was insulting."
330,3,"Been here a few times, always get the pho. I love letting the Thai basil steep in the pho. It adds such a nice flavor combined with the lime. To be honest, I don't think I've actually had pho anywhere else so take this review for what It's worth"
331,2,"I don't really see the hype in this place. Granted, I've only been twice and both times the drinks I ordered (a mocha and then a green tea) were lovely but I was kind of creeped out by the uncleanliness. 

The first visit I sat outside and read and I really enjoyed that. The second time I came to study and do computer work so I was inside. The entire time I was tempted to leave but my tea was in a glass and it was scalding hot so I couldn't gulp it down quickly. 

Anyway, moral of the story is unless you want to be surrounded by flies, sticky tables, and dirty floors, don't come here. Or just sit outside and ignore the interior when ordering."
332,1,This club is pretty trashy. The bathrooms are disgusting and you may need a body condom just to breathe the air in there. If happens to be just one of those nights post break up and you are out with your girlfriends you CAN get your dance on here. They have cheap shots and you can get hammered without breaking the bank. The average age is 21.
333,1,"Ugh. I had so much hope for this place!

The service is friendly. And the servers are knowledgable about the ingredients in the food. I keep coming back here because a. I keep hoping the wait time will eventually become shorter and b. because there aren't a whole lot of places where one can get a tofu scramble around here. 

BUT This place is not worth the wait. I waited almost 2 hours since my arrival on a Sunday morning for an tofu scramble, which the kitchen screwed up. Decent, but nothing to rave about. So ends my rather disappointing affair with the friendly toast."
334,3,"The pizza was good, and I'm kinda picky with pizza, but I liked it. I went there while they were closing though (10 pm?) so they really didn't have much choice.

Don't get the baklava! It was soft and soggy. I didn't even take a bite becuase I was grossed out by how soft the filo on top was."
335,3,"Very cute - love Sweet  :)  We got one of each of the mini cupcakes whihc was awesome we got to try all the different types - the red velvet, pumpkin and cappuccino were definite winners (love that the pumpkin had gold flakes on top!).  Some of them tasted a bit like they'd been sitting for a while and the only frosting we enjoyed were the cream-cheese based ones which was on about half of our cupcakes.  The regular buttercream frosting was way too sweet, like tastelessly sweet.  But decor is cute, minimalistic and fun - all in all, pretty good stuff.  (Oh, only offer lowfat milk, what's with that?  I mean hell, I'm in there eating cupcakes, why would I want lowfat milk, right?)  :)"
336,3,"Overrated. Long lines, overpriced, overly spicy food, no seating. Pretty good food, though. Lots of other places I'd rather go on the Ave to get Thai, though."
337,1,Inxs Wireless is a T-mobile 'exclusive' dealer - what this means is that they are NOT a T-mobile shop but they will pretend to be one and sell you T-mobile stuff at a mark-up that can be as high as 20%. Sounds like a scam - feels like one. The staff treat you like dirt if you're not going to buy one of their most expensive phones. A place to avoid - go to Harvard Sq instead if you use T-mobile.
338,3,"The house gyros are pretty good and service is lightning fast. My friends' orders were out before they had time to get their drinks and sit down. Not sure what the sodium content of those gyros are though because everyone who got one (pretty much everyone at the table) was really thirsty for the next 2-3 hours after the meal. I've heard it's ""pretty authentic"" but I wouldn't put much stock in that... I guess it's authentic in the sense that it made me really miss the sketchy hole-in-the-wall gyro places in Athens."
339,2,"Decent at best.  Not the worst, but not the best for sure!  Add $2.99 for a cesar salad? Wtf!? That was the worst cesar salad I've ever had!! But great atmosphere for a date.  Oh the house bread sucks too..."
340,3,"The food is OK.  The decor is unique and fun.  The prices are a bit steep for the amount of food you get.

Went in for breakfast ... it's an order at the counter and grab a number kind of place.  We got the croque-madame with country potatoes ($12) and the salmon benedict ($13).  

The croque was tasty and the bechamel sauce was heavy handed with horseradish.  I did enjoy it quite a bit, but I was also really hungry.  The potatoes on the other hand, though seasoned well, were super soggy and mushy.  I wasn't a fan of them at all.  

The hollandaise on the benedict was tasty but the portion was quite small.  Only a sliver of salmon was given per benedict.

Overall, for the amount we paid I guess I just wanted more.  I might be back to try the banh mi and/or the pho ... but I probably won't."
341,2,"I go back and forth with this place. I've had some very good meals here, and some very mediocre ones. As mentioned in another review, there are instances were the food is just bland and everything tastes the same. I suspect this is due to the sheer number of options on the menu. I think they'd be better off dropping some of the excess items from the menu and focusing on being very good at executing fewer dishes. Quality over quantity folks! As far as the food, the item that always stood out to me as consistenly good was the paella. Everything else has been hit or miss. Oh, and the sangria was good as well

Now for some gripes. The service is slow and sloppy. It can get really loud in there during weekends. And for some reason their website address is listed incorrectly on a few different websites/Google.. Do they even have a website?

Honestly there are other places for tapas that I would recommend over Mi Luna."
342,3,"This locale definitely does not have the same cool vibe as the one in Studio City. However, if I'm in the area, it's late, I'm itching for deli food, and there's been some drinking done, then it's still a goto. Menu is huge and generally there is something for everyone."
343,2,Didn't live up to expectations. The counter is kind of cool--it takes up almost the whole restaurant. The food is just ok as far as the burgers and hot dogs and pie go. Wasn't into the macaroni salad.
344,3,"Hellllllloooooo ...long line out the door. Yeah, I don't like waiting. The place is cute, their cupcakes are cute but they're nothing special. Red Velvet is pretty good as well as dark chocolate, but they're not worth it. I don't wanna go to stanford just for cupcakes that I can whip up in my own conventional oven. no thanks."
345,3,"Le Monde was one of my favorite places to go when I was at college at Columbia.  The food and service are reliable -- Waiters are nice and helpful, usually a wait but they are very accommodating.  

The food is solid-- I liked the chicken club, french onion soup, and moule frites. It's very reasonably priced, especially compared to the other restaurants in this chain (l'express, french roast, etc.).  The dishes are reliable and it's a nice place to go with family or friends in the summertime, when they have seating outdoors."
346,1,"Ok there is no Fairy God Mother that could change this place enough to make me want to see if the glass slipper fits. We ordered from this place multiple times for lunch and none of the food was ever that good. My co-worker ordered a tuna fish sub with lettuce onions, pickles and extra Mayo and he ended up with a fried fish sandwich with extra tartar sauce. I felt that every time we asked them for something toasted, they felt put out by it because I ordered an Italian and a meatball sub and neither of them were toasted. I swear I got bean sprouts on my Italian one time too, I'm still not quite too sure what that was all about. I'm just not a fan of this place."
347,1,"Well I continue to be disappointed in my search for halfway decent Chinese in the Chapel Hill area.

This place ought to be shut down by the health department!  The place was absolutely FILTHY and crawling with flies.  The food was tasteless, unless it tasted bad.  I went in because I saw some Asian people eating there and what they were eating looked good - turns out they were staff and what they were eating is not on the menu, it was REAL food that they prepared for themselves.

The stuff on the menu is just no good.  And it is no better when it's on your (not very clean, sort of sticky) table, either.  I'd have to be bombed out of my mind before I'd touch this stuff again, and at that point I'd probably pass out (if I were lucky) before a morsel passed my lips.

Fortunately, given that I don't drink like that, I'm in little danger of facing that particular eventuality.

There is no question, never again.  There should be a ""filthy"" option under ""ambience"".  This place isn't ""dive-y"" - it's a flat out nasty hole-in-the-wall DIVE."
348,1,"I'll admit it...
I love McDonald's.  I know, its practically heresy for some people, but whenever I go to McDonald's, my inner 6 year old comes out to play.  I am particularly fond of their hamburgers, Big Macs, and french fries.  The rest of the menu can disappear as far as I'm concerned because those are all that I ever order.
I travel quite a bit at times.  Last summer, I drove from Austin to Massachusetts and back again.  Other summer trips involve driving from Florida to Michigan and back as well as Austin to New York.  
When I drive across the country, the one restaurant I eat at more than any other is McDonalds.  
As a chain, their sanitation is generally pretty high, and I am usually confident if I get a burger from there in the middle of nowhere (at least nowhere to me), I won't get sick an hour later with food poisoning.  
I trust McDonalds with my general health when I'm driving on long trips to keep me fed and not barfing.

There is only ONE McDonalds in this whole freaking country I absolutely refuse to ever ever ever eat in again and it's this location.  I work nearby and have over the last couple years walked over for lunch every 2-3 weeks or so.  I have always found the place a little sketchy, but I stopped going in because the last time I went there, it was hands down the filthiest, dirtiest, stickiest McDonalds I've ever seen.  

Most McDonald's locations (even the ones that are a bit older) look clean and well cared for.  This place looks like it crawled inside a teenage boy's gym sock and died there.  I've seen roach coaches at construction sites that look cleaner and more sanitary.  

The last time I went in there to pick up food, I was so icked out looking at the sticky counters and dirty looking prep areas (I can only speak for the ones that are visible from the front counter) that my stomach turned just thinking about putting the food in my mouth (and I'm pretty brave about trying about anything).  

After I left, I actually threw my food away rather than to risk eating it.  I have only done that once in my entire life and it was at a Chinese restaurant where I noticed the F (15%) health inspection sanitary rating after I had already paid and was about to walk out.  

While I love my Mickey D's, I won't go to this location again until someone tents the place with an aquarium dome and pumps bleach in to disinfect it."
349,1,Worst bland sanwhich of my life.  The tea was not very flavorful either.... Why is this place still open?
350,2,"This is the kind of Indian restaurant that seems to charge more based on pretty dish-ware and sort-of cozy decor.  I went with a large group (10ish) and the service was good, especially considering how many orders we had, who was sharing what where, etc.   

The food was nothing spectacular.  The chat papri was really tasty, but I don't think that dish requires a lot of cooking skill.  

Each of the main dishes I tried (Aloe Chole, Veggie Jalfrezi,  Vindaloo) seemed mostly the same, and sort of reminded me the sauce in a Chef Boyardee can, though the Vindaloo was spicy.  Not great Indian food, and certainly not worth what we paid."
351,3,"You know that one kid who is impossible to shop for? You look everywhere for something and there's a lot of pressure because for your birthday he got you the coolest miniature ping-pong table, basically your favorite possession now and one you are considering declaring an heirloom and passing on to your progeny, only doing so might prevent the progeny part of the plan from ever happening. 

Yeah that kid. Aahs is where you find something for him. Posters, gag gifts, Sex in the City trivia game sets, novelty tees and early bird Halloween costumes. It's sort of the kind of place you take your young relatives if they ever visit you and then after they leave you think about getting your tubes tied. But you feel guilty because you definitely bought yourself a doll -- oh, excuse me, *action figure.*

Right. Aahs also carries Angry Little Girls gear and products."
352,1,"I contracted a really bad food borne illness at this particular Zankou Chicken years ago so I have steered clear of it ever since. I was extremely ill for two weeks or more. I always get decent food at the Glendale location though, always fresh. Keep in mind I said ""years"" ago though so I don't know if it is better now or not."
353,3,"We have eaten at New Delhi about three times in the past six months and they have all been generally pleasant experiences.

One criticisms is that certain of the starters are not very good.  The samosas were pretty bad during our first visit and the crab cakes were almost all fill and no crab during our second visit (we decided to skip the starters on our third visit).

The chicken tikka masala is quite good.  The chicken is tender and the sauce is creamy and flavorful as one would expect from this bread and butter of Indian cuisine.

The lamb vindaloo was OK; I've discovered that it's really hard to find good vindaloo in So Cal.  I miss Viceroy in Berkeley.

Naan was good.

I found the service to be pleasant and food was served in a timely fashion.  

Based on the location, the comments about the view from the dinning room window are interesting--this is definitely not a ""scenic"" part of Colorado Blvd..."
354,3,"Tip to Toe is a great little gem right by USC.  Call in advance before you go because, especially when the sororities have events coming up, it gets really busy and they might tell you to come back later.  Just because you make an appointment doesn't mean you'll get seen right away, but it does mean you'll get in within a reasonable amount of time.

The women there are very sweet and the spa manicure and pedicure are unbeatable for the price.  They do a very thorough job with cuticles and calluses and it's a great time to catch up on your gossip by perusing some of the many, many magazines they have for you to read.  They have great polishes by OPI and essie, and, by some miracle, their manicures last for almost a week without chipping.  Hallelujah!

Why only three stars?  Sometimes the pedicure water isn't hot enough, which isn't a cardinal sin, but doesn't make for the most pleasant experience possible.  However, the major problem I have with the place is their waxing.  I've only  let them wax my eyebrows once and never again.  They came out looking fine, but they double dipped the sticks in the wax which is a total no-no.  I imagine the wax pot is a germy nightmare!  If I were you, I'd stick to nails.  With that, everything is autoclaved and super clean."
355,3,"They do what you would expect, provide a decent massage at a reasonable price.."
356,1,"Dr. Donald Curtis is just a dentist and an expensive one at that.  Try to get an appointment with him (go figure...why would someone want to see him?)  He's seldom in his office and it's hit or miss as to whether he will return your call.
I have found another dentist who is great so I definitely won't be continuing with him.
Is there a zero rating?"
357,2,Overpriced for the ambiance and average dishes.  With so many better restaurants in the area you have many better choices.
358,3,[2.5] Everything about the place  including the food is below A-OK. The service just brought the place to a A-OK. I will never be back here again. It just doesn't have much to offer.
359,3,"this oren's location is really small. the espresso is better than starbucks's, and the milk is steamed more skillfully. the baristas are really nice and over-caffinated like those who work in a neighborhood coffee shop, which contributes to the general neighborhoody feel of the place. you can also choose beans from the wall of jars across from the main counter. their brewed coffee is just okay but i've found nowhere in ny that brews like on the west coast and oren's is better than most. i highly recommend the scottish shortbread cookies. they are buttery, cakey and... energizing. downside; its a little expensive"
360,3,"Very good, live music too. Wish this place existed when I was in grad school... Welcomed addition."
361,3,"Surprised this isn't 4 stars considering everyone is obsessed with chipotle. I'm not a huge fan myself. Definitely good quantity but for some reason I never leave super satisfied. My favorite is the carne asada bowl with rice, which is around 6-7 bucks."
362,3,"11/29/2011

We went looking for post cards.  They don't have any! We have looked everywhere around here and nothing!  We did have the last (2) chicken enchiladas.  They were covered in really good gooey cheese and only $3.99 each.  We went back for another to take home to my daughter, but they were the last (2).  Items in this kitchen paradise were high priced.  It is fun to walk around in this store and see everything.  We got some good coffee: Toasted Praline and Creme Brulee and a white tea with strawberry rhubarb.  One of the disappointing things about this place is that they only have a few of their coffees in small packages.  The other flavors of coffee outside of these require a $7.99 or $16.99 purchase.  The cold salad side dishes were $8.99-$10.99/pounds.  There was a large shrimp skewer was $24.99/pound.  We went outside the store into the mall to sit on very comfortable cloth-covered wingback chairs to eat the enchiladas.  There were not empty tables so we chatted with an elderly gentleman who was waiting for his wife to get her hair done at the salon.  The mall was a lot busier than it was last September, but this is the Christmas shopping season. And although it was busy we did not hear or see the cash registers ringing."
363,3,"At the suggestion of a close personal friend, I went here for lunch today.  Actually, I went over there for take out.

Small place.  Cool place.

The staff was warm and friendly.  The place was clean.

The service was quick.  The prices are great.

It isn't ""real"" Japanese food, in the sense that the food is highly Americanized.  I am all for Americanized non-American food, with the exception of Japanese food.  There are tons of rolls and the such.  If rolls and things along those lines float your boat, wind your watch, or blow your hair back, then go for it.  It is a great place for what it is.

The fish is fresh and of pretty good quality."
364,3,"I honestly thought Hip Kitty would be a bit more hip than the name suggested.

It's a fine place for drinks, but then again so is any place with a full bar. It's small, dim and intimate, with almost a grave undertone. It's one of those places where you can't have too much fun; raised noise levels will certainly garner some murderous stares from the jazz lovers that mean serious business. 

The outdoor patio works well for loud drunks (like me) to let loose.

The Large Cheese Plate is a generous spread - perfect compliment to the Gritty Kitty dirty martini. The lounge food is dainty but pretty decent: grilled cheese and tomato soup, wedge salad, mac n cheese, pepperoni pizza. All these can easily be consumed by one person. 

A place for a random Tuesday dinner, why not...although it definitely isn't my preferred type of spot for Saturday night cocktails."
365,3,"I was really excited when Moksa finally opened since I walk by it everyday on my way to work, but it's really not living up to the hype - and I've been there twice for dinner. Its menu somewhat reminds me of Myer+Chang, but lacks the distinct and explosive flavors that the latter has.

Atmosphere: Modern chic, fun deco at the bar area, but the back room feels somewhat cold and segregated.

Drinks menu: Creative cocktails! Snap dragon was nice and spicy. ""Water"" shot was also fun to drink. Scorpion bowl was only so-so, way too much ice.

Food menu: Overall way too salty for me, and most of the items were not anything special - nothing you can't get at a regular Chinese or Asian restaurants. Portions are also small for what you pay for. My favorite is the eggplant or pork steam bun - both are very good. Silver pin noodle was also nice. Ramen was not bad, but the flavor is very different from your usual Japanese ones. Skewers were all quite tasty, but only one skewer per order. Roti didn't do it for me - I've tried most of them since I was there with a big group. Maybe I just didn't like the flatbread.

I'm not sure I'll go back voluntarily, at least not for the food. 

One last note - The adjoining Naga nightclub was fun. A bunch of us went after dinner and had a great time."
366,3,"A ""mall"" I can get around in without getting worn out!  A couple of My favorite kinds of stores - places with food and kitchen gadgets!  a few nice choices of restaurants to sit down for lunch with the family without feeling like it's so crowded you can't find a table to sit at as opposed to a large cafeteria style food court.

We happened upon University Mall while searching out ""A Southern Season"" and honestly, I have a hard time calling it a mall.  It has a couple ""anchor"" stores, a number of empty storefronts, a couple ""art"" stores, a few other stores and a few restaurants.  Still, it's not a bad place to go if one wants to get away and browse around a few stores.  The reality is, the mall isn't the draw - A.S.S. is the real draw here and that's what will bring people to the ""mall""

Glad I went, though... I'll be back, next time I decide to run out to A Southern Season"
367,3,"This place will not offend, but it probably will not titillate, either."
368,3,"Hank's is kind of cute and all, but nothing special. 

One of my best friends and I hit up Hank's for dinner tonight purely out of convenience.  We were originally going to check out Carolina Kitchen, but we were not feeling the 15 minute wait for sub average food, so we headed about over about 15 paces to Hank's.

With only about three tables occupied with diners, the restaurant felt bare and lifeless. But that was not really a concern. We just wanted some grub. Our waitress promptly helped us as soon as we were seated. (I mean, what else was she doing?) 

We start off with the calamari which wasn't so great. It tasted a bit undercooked and a bit too salty. With a decent selection of burgers, fish, tacos and a few specialty sandwiches, I was surprised to see that none of them came with any sides. Considering most of these items ranged from $9-$13, I felt as if it was a bit over priced. 

I went ahead and ordered the steak salad. The steak was tender and cooked perfectly the veggie quality was pretty average. The best thing about the salad is that it is huge. It was like an endless bowl of crunch. I was still working on it for 20 minutes after my friend had finished his crab cake sandwich (complete with a crumbling roll.)

Although we usually stick around and order drinks indefinitely, we decided to chill out and order the hot fudge brownie sundae for dessert. You can't really go wrong on a hot fudge sundae, but I've definitely had better.

Honestly, this place is not too different than your typical Bennigans/Friday's/Applebees type of dining establishment, except with less menu variety. If you like playing it safe with your Americana dining however, you may take a liking to Hank's."
369,1,"Yuck,  the pizza is too greasy and way overpriced.   Plus there is a snippy, rude female that was in there that just cannot be friendly to anyone it seems.  Maybe she is gone by now, who knows.   With all the pizza in ann arbor,  this is not even on the radar."
370,1,came here on a lunch break.. spent 5 minutes in line then waited another 3 for the cashier to finish being a cook for the other customers. once I finally got my order done and he gave me a bowl.. I had to wait for the sauce boss to give me my juice.. not a very impatient person but they easily made me one. oh and watch out for the pens.. got ink all over my hand when I signed my receipt. they got the first and last laugh.. and also 1 star. keep the change and make something of it mongo.
371,1,I don't know what all of the hype is about.  I was really excited to get a cupcake here and was highly disappointed once I took my first bite.  I purchased a red velvet cupcake and the cake portion was dry and the icing was just disgusting.   Red Velvet cupcakes should have some twang from the buttermilk in the cake and the yumminess from the cream cheese frosting.  This cupcake had neither.  It fell very flat.
372,2,"I was really disappointed in this place. The food was overpriced, the place was cramped, and the service was slow. How does it take 20 minutes to pick up a roll of sushi from the counter..The sushi kind of just tasted like any other sushi place to be honest.

374,2,"I am a boba-addict who drove from Detroit to Ann Arbor for the sole purpose of getting boba.  My strawberry green tea was flavor-less (although a step up from Goldfish Tea in Royal Oak).  The tapioca pearls were stiff but had a nice flavor.  My friend ordered a milk tea w/pearls and disliked it so much that he threw half of it away.

Oh, and they have nice comfy couches and a bunch of tables for you to sit at.  Honestly, if Detroit and AA were closer, I'd prolly come here to study all the time. :X  It's a nice place to study and grab a drink.

Meh I've experienced better is the perfect description for Mo Mo Tea.  I'm hoping I came on an off-day, but since AA is so far away, I doubt I'll be back."
375,3,"32oz growlers--- Need I say more for the beer-lovers out there?

I ordered the Nurse Betty (Veggie burger), it kinda fell apart but it was tasty. 

Nothing to write home about but I will probably be back..."
376,3,I am in the GSB and this location is not as good as the others on campus.  in fact yesterday a co-worker said their prices are actually higher that the one across the campus.  That is ridiculous to have two different pricing systems and sometimes the coffee has a burnt flavor.  I have switched to straight steamed almond milk for that reason at this location and then use my own coffee in the office.
377,2,"We had lunch last January 9, 2012. We ordered the crab bisque soup and the famous ""cuban sandwich"". They first served the soup and it was just okay, nothing special. Then after almost 20 minutes of waiting,  they served our ""cuban sandwich"" which was small, blunt and full of mustard. With the price of the sandwich,  we would expect at least a chips or pickles with it, but nothing! We will not going back to this place again.  It was expensive and overrated."

Chicken pasta: its good at first when it's nice and hot. But they don't give you enough sauce."
379,1,"""Ok, you need to get that woman out of here."" This is Tedesco's idea of customer service.

Is this site cursed? This is at least the third restaurant that has set up shop at this location since we moved to Chapel Hill. Unless they get Robert Irvine and the Restaurant Impossible crew out here soon, Tedesco's will be the third to close.

Our visit started ominously enough. As we were being seated by somebody (a host? a busboy? a spin instructor?) who looked like he might not even work there (USA/Korea cap on backwards and cut-off black skinny jeans), my son nearly slipped on the tile floor. The dude, who was nice lest you think I've disparaged him, apologized for the slick floors as they had been having a problem with the tile ""perspiring"". I've never heard of this phenomenon. Anyways, we moved to a different spot, but the tile was still wet in various places around the restaurant. 

The young chap told us he could get our drinks even though he wouldn't be our waiter. Our waitress, he said, was busy in the back. We didn't see her for at least 5 minutes after getting our drinks. It turns out she was the only waitress there, and there were at least six tables for her to wait.

We got a lunch special chicken parmesan ($8.95) and a Hawaiian pizza ($18.99). The chicken parm was a bit too tough in some places, but the pizza was the big problem. Before I could say anything, spin instructor dude apologized for bringing out a small pizza rather than a large. He said he'd be bringing out one more but didn't specify what size it would be. At first the pizza looked and tasted like it would be great, but my wife, who has a nose that knows, soon figured out that the pineapple had gone bad. I isolated a piece of pineapple and had to concur. My wife told our waitress. After going back to the kitchen, the waitress came back to tell us that she had tasted the pineapple and that it had indeed gone bad and tasted of alcohol. She apologized profusely and said that her manager was aware of the situation. She told us that they'd opened a new can for our next pizza. I pointed out to her that cap dude had told us that they (it turned out to be ""he"") were already preparing our second pizza. I asked her if it would be a small or a large, and she assured me that it would be a large.

That ended up being a moot point. We never got the next pizza. We waited maybe fifteen minutes more, and my wife wanted to leave and asked to speak to the manager. The waitress went back to the kitchen, returned to us and said that the manager could speak to her in the back near the kitchen. The manager and the cook turned out to be one and the same. My wife was upset that the manager hadn't once come out to say anything and that nothing was getting resolved. This being the land of free speech, my wife told the patrons at the door about what was going on and they left! At that point the waitress told the manager/cook, ""Ok, you need to get that woman out of here.""

Fine way to run a restaurant."

383,2,"I came here for the first time last week and I don't know, their chai was okay. The baristas were a little rude. I told them that it was my first time there and I asked what kind of chai they would recommend. and the girl at the registers rather impatient response was, ""Uh, just get a chai"" I asked for a recommendation not for her to just make a decision. I wanted to try something new since they are known for their Chai, but I left not anymore enlightened. So, overall this trabant was EH. Latte art doesn't make your drink taste any better."
384,2,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that this place has gone downhill in the last few years. They always seem to be understaffed and it's hard to get help when you need it. 

For some reason at this particular Borders location, when they go to ring up your purchase they always seem to ask if you want to particiapte in a donation program of some kind. One time it was Seattles Best coffee for servicepeople in Afghanistan. Another time it was purchasing a childrens book for Pasadena public school libraries. Basically, they are asking you to buy coffee or a book from the store and they will donate it on your behalf. The cynic in me can't help but notice that this particular Borders store also benefits from my donation - after all, I'm buying a bag of coffee or a book from them, which they, in turn, donate on my behalf. So, is it really ethically right for them to benefit and make money off this donated purchase of mine? Why the hell doesn't the corporation just donate the books to the kids? Why put it on the consumer while Borders makes a profit from it? It just kind of bugs me."
385,2,"Bizarre, but this is medical science history.  Kind of like rubber necking at a horrible auto accident. Glad I never went too close into this specific medical anomalies area of study.

386,2,"I haven't eaten Portuguese often. I don't think I will again, either. I ordered a fish with seafood stuffing along with veggies. I enjoyed the veggies, but not the fish. 

The service was great and the ambience was really nice. I especially like the walkway. Nice place to take a date. My fiance loved it. I suppose I have pickier food tastes. Perhaps I'll just order something like a steak next time LOL"
387,3,"I think I could have had a 5-star experience if...

...I didn't have the upstairs corner room that: was above some suite that would play music loudly, had a bus stop in front of it with windows facing a busy street.
...the service was a little better/more attentive...felt like college kids running the place because that's what the staff was. My first night, the happy hour wine was put away already when I went down 15 minutes before it was to end and the food was gone. 
My first breakfast, no one greeted me to tell me what I had to do and there wasn't a place to sit inside. The outside patio was nice but COLD...heat lamp was out of gas! They were also out of one of the dishes. Then I overheard someone talking very loudly about the B&B business and money, etc. and it just killed the relaxing atmosphere. 
My second breakfast, they told me they said they only had a ""backup quiche"" left besides the other dish. I didn't understand if they were trying to persuade me to not order the quiche so they wouldn't have to heat it or what?

Three stars are for good location, good bath products, cute decor and nice bed. Would give it another chance only if I could get an interior room."
388,1,"This place was such a let-down.

My friend (and roommate) raved about it, so I trusted him . . .that ought to have taught me, but that's a whole different rant.

Okay.  We went for lunch.  At noon on a sunny day, it was small, dim, and almost completely empty but somehow gave the impression of being crowded and cramped.  Although there were tables near the window, we were seated all the way in the back, near the bathrooms.

Although the only other people in the joint had already ordered and received their food, service was abominable.  It took forever to order, and even longer to get our food.  The waitress DROPPED my burger and caught it against her front, then just tipped it back onto the plate and set it in front of me.  Um, what?  The burger was small, dry, and flavorless.  

After all of that, the food is ala carte and quite pricey for the quality and portion size.  

I'm sure I'm going to be run out of Pasadena for posting this, but I am NOT a fan of Pie 'n Burger.  You won't catch me in there any time soon."
389,2,"I definitely did not receive the 4+ star experience here.  I expected a lot more from this cute place.  Came here for Sunday brunch.  Here are the things that contributed to the 2 star review:

1.  We waited a long time for everything.  The server just greeting us took a long time.  Bringing our utensils took a long time.  Getting our orders too a long time.  Bringing us water, beverages, etc, all took a long time.  It wasn't particularly busy either.  It was very quiet actually, and the waiter had time to stop and talk to other tables.

2.  They forgot to bring us bread.  This doesn't seem like a big deal, but along with everything else they forgot, it added up.  Every single table besides us had bread.  Keep reading for other examples.

3.  They forgot our soups.  Just never showed up.

4.  The waiter asked us immediately after serving our food if we would like some salt and pepper.  Proceeded to immediately forget.  Never came back, but he was just strolling around the rest of the floor.  We had to ask another server for salt and pepper, which he brought us immediately.

5. Food was extremely bland and boring.  There was nothing special about it.  No deep flavors, no excitement.  Just very plain, white-picket fence boring.

6.  Took forever to get our bill.  All the tables were cleared around us.  Our plates were already taken away.  But we were just left sitting there.  

7.  Just cuz.

So all in all, wouldn't come back here again.  Waste of a good $50 for boring food and horrible service.  Could've went and bought a shit load of McDonald's hash browns, which in itself would've been way better than our entire meal combined."

391,3,"I find it amusing that I've been in Houston for over two years, find myself at the Ginger Man (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-ginger-man-houston) more often than not, and yet I only made it to Little Woodrow's a few weeks ago.

Truthfully, they're pretty similar bars.  The clientele is a lot more laid back than most of the bars in The Village and lot less frat daddy/douche baggy.  Yes, there are darts and pool.  (Ginger Man does not have a pool table.)  Yes, they have a huge selection of beer.  Yes, it is much more spacious than most places in The Village.

And while I liked it a lot, it is just one of those places that doesn't leave a strong impression on you.  Which I find amusing since I enjoy the Ginger Man so much and they're so similar in patrons, vibe, and service.  Nevertheless, it is a solid bar and you can see plenty of dogs on any given night."

393,1,"My experience with Samson Realty was UNPLEASANT.
 WALK-IN'S WELCOME? NOT SO MUCH.... 
So my wife and I were living in a sublet for 2 months right around the block from Samson. We wanted to find another place ASAP so we walked over there on a Saturday afternoon, since walk-in's are so welcome. Well, we walked in and stood their for a solid minute before a woman turned to us and said ""Um, I'm busy right now"" and asked some guy Josh or Justin to help us. His response to us was ""I'm not actually here right now, but I'll help you for a minute"". WTF?!?! He certainly wasn't a hologram, and he was in fact actually there. So Josh/Justin/Whateverhisnamewas scrolled through some properties we might be interested in and told us he would email us properties. 
Well, 2 days went by and nothing... So I called back and asked to speak with him and he wasn't there. I called again, spoke to him and he never sent any properties to me. By that point I was officially over Samson Realty.
 The service there was RUDE and NOT HELPFUL. I will never go there again nor would I EVER recommend them to anybody. The staff was rude and didn't seem to care for our business."

396,3,"Hamburger Hamlet used to be amazing. When I temped at Caltech, it was my favorite lunch spot. The Marilyn Burger (avocado, Jack cheese and Dijon mayo) was always scrumptious. 

But then the service took a dive. People with huge parties arriving AFTER we placed our orders would get all of their food before ours. On one occasion, we actually went up to the kitchen counter to ask where our food was because our server vanished and we had been waiting an hour for our meals. We were given a gift card as compensation, so we went back one final time. The same thing happened in a different section. And for some unknown reason, my aunt's side of fruit was smothered in ranch dressing. Smothered. Seriously?

The Marilyn Burger, Potato Patch Omelette  and the mud pie are the only dishes I've tried and they were all delicious. However, I would be cautious about eating here again if I only had a limited amount of time to eat.

I would recommend sitting in the section to the right of the entrance. It's got huge wooden booths and it's decorated like a classy huntsman lodge."
397,2,"Experiences usually do not encompass the service, though it does give that extra pull/push points.  However, here, the experience definitely made it an upper 2.5 lower 3.  The pizza itself made it a lower 3.  

I don't know how they made such bland pizza.  Is it lacking in salt?  is that it?  is it because they hate flavor?  Is it because there are apparently no good restaurants in Palo Alto?  Nothing is rated above a 3.5 star.  Why, oh why did I come down here?  To visit my friend, that's why.

We got 1/2 eggplant feta and 1/2 zucchini pesto.  The eggplant was SO GROSS.  It was soggy and mushy just like I knew eggplant was going to be.  I knew it.  Knew it.  The zucchini was a little bit better but still so bland.  There was no zing, no ""hint of chili.""  The cheese they used was nice though, the mozzarella.  My friend and I had to pour on the red pepper flakes and the powdered cheese.  And even then, I wanted to ask for salt and pepper.

It was really a shame that the pizza was so disappointing because the crust was delicious.  It was crunchy on the outside and chewy and doughy on the inside.  But that does not do anything for the slop that was put on top of it.  

It's like that pair of slacks, made of really nice fabric and just the right color.  But it makes your butt look big and your legs look stubby.  So you don't wear it.  And you don't buy i."
398,2,"Stopped into Schaub's for quick bite to eat. Deli counter service is horrible. I think they need training on what kind of sandwiches they offer, so that they can explain what options you have with your order. They asked me if I wanted my sandwich hot or cold. However, it was as if the task was foreign and never done. They should be the authority on their product, but apparently the customer should know more."
399,1,"Hi Jill,

Max W. has sent you a message on Yelp:

Lies...lies...lies..

""FYI: The roll was NEVER going to be re used.  It would have been tossed.  Since you didn't pay for it, we have the right to do with it as we see if.  Its not for your consumption.  But since you stuffed your face and was embarassed by it, feel free to write lies and exaggerate the story as you see fit.  Free loaders are not welcome.""

I don't know who this is, but I got this angry message. Prior to this, Max W. apologized saying he would talk to the waiter and manager... so I assumed he was a superior, but now I have no idea where this anger is coming from. 

I clearly am not embarrassed. And I clearly am not angry about that fact. I just find re-plating food that has been served an issue that all people in the area should all know and be aware for. I think that is my good deed of the day. :)"

Vanilla disguised in chocolate frosting= DRY DRY DRY DRY DRY. Don't order it and Don't fall for it's disguise and mistake it for a chocolate cupcake either. [This is the reason for dropping a star]

Strawberry= More enjoyable than the Vanilla. Maybe eating it with real strawberries would make it even better (now there's an idea)

Red Velvet= Yummy. Yummy. Yummy. I'm still convinced ""sprinkles"" is code for ""crack"" Just sayin....

401,2,"I'm sort of sad to give this place 2 stars, but honestly, there is a lot better barbecue out there than Goode Company.  I went on a taste-testing mission of Houston BBQ prior to a large, Texas-themed event, and had the chance to really focus on the nuances of various BBQ joints.  

To me, the test of a good BBQ joint is the brisket.  Goode's brisket is way too dry, and the sauce leaves much to be desired.  It's more like ketchup than barbecue sauce.  I always recommended this place to friends because it's sort of a tradition, but now I steer them towards Luling City Market, or Hinze's out in Sealy if they're willing to make the drive.  

I do hear they have great turkey, so if you're going there for turkey, you'll probably be impressed."
402,2,"A bunch of us came here for drinks and dinner a couple of months ago. All I remember from the night is how salty everything was. Not sure if it was just our one time experience, but I think all six of us were in agreement that (1) the mac and cheese was waaay too salty (2) the mussels were pretty good but the broth they were in was waaaay too salty (3) squid salad was salty (4) two pizzas were mediocre (i think we got one clam/bacon (salty) and maybe the sausage? don't remember but it was just okay). I'm miffed because this place seems to have gotten good reviews, so were they just having an off night? Lack of quality control on the salt shaker for just that one evening? Not sure, but don't think any of us will come back any time too soon."
403,1,"Horrible customer service.  It's bad enough they're located in PG Plaza, but that's no excuse for piss poor service.  The MAC counter is located inside the Macy's and I've been there numerous occasions and never once have I received a different outcome.  Only once has someone greeting me, any other time no one ever greets me, they try to flutter around like they are so busy even when there are hardly any customers there.  Most times I'm there to buy products, not ""try stuff on"".  So I just need to be rung up and be sent on my way.  Depending on what the product is I'll either go to the Clinique counter or visit the MAC store in Pentagon City or Macy's in Pentagon City.

Also, by judging the makeup on the employees faces, it looks like clown make up and I would never have them apply anything for me.  It's overly excessive and doesn't compliment the person wearing it.  Like if MAC is promoting a new shade or collection... everyone can't wear the same shade of blue and red.  I want to leave looking like a lady not a clown hopping into the main ring or someone's birthday cake -____- The one time an employee actually acknowledge me there, he suggested this blush, it was the worst shade of red to offer someone who is fair skinned.  I told him it looked like I was slapped in the face, he tried to convince me otherwise, I declined and I'll stick to the MAC in Pentagon City for tips."
404,3,"Great burgers (especially the burger combinations), but the lines are ridiculously long and the prices are pretty high. I recommend the Bobby Blue or the Napa Valley (the fries are also delicious with the chipotle ketchup)."

406,2,"EDIT: 
Dr. Suki:
Pardon my bluntness, but if you are a business person last, then you probably would have cared to mention the second option of scaling the teeth at $800-1200, rather than the $1800 deep cleaning total, $450 per quadrant. Giving patients a few options in their treatment care is one of the best things a doctor can do, while recommending the best option, especially if finances are of concern. The other dentist we went to did the scaling option at a cheaper price, which I am not trying to downplay your service since your office isn't an hour away. Maybe in the future, the staff will be taught to keep patients informed and provide multiple treatment options.

****************

Dr. Suki had an $89 special that included a consult, xray, and general teeth cleaning. Upon arrival, they looked at my boyfriend's teeth, determined that he may need a deep cleaning, and charged $80 for an x-ray with no general teeth cleaning. Not sure why they didn't just do a general cleaning  as well considering it was only another $10 to get the whole package. A deep cleaning would have cost $1800 with Dr. Suki. Maybe dentists can pull this kind of stunt on someone who has dental insurance, but not on people who don't... Needless to say, the boyfriend never came back. 

He then scheduled an appointment with another dentist that his family trusted an hour away. This dentist had a month's waiting list and for good reason. He had to do another xray with this dentist, but at least the dentist examined the xray right then and there and kept him thoroughly informed with his treatment plan. After looking at the xray, the dentist did a thorough cleaning using a high-pressure water spray to clean out the tartar build-up inside the gums. Charging him only $110 total (including the charge of the xray), he determined that my boyfriend should come back after 6 months to see if there is any wear of the teeth underneath the gums (thus actually needing a deep cleaning). But for now, he needs to do the water pik and floss more. According to this dentist, my boyfriend didn't need to have a deep cleaning just yet. I really question the validity of dentists who just recommend an expensive deep cleaning before even trying other more affordable methods to clean inside the gums.That truly makes me not trust just any dentist, thus the distrust for Dr. Suki's team. 

Of course the easier and lazier way to make money is to recommend an unnecessary expensive deep cleaning before going through the ""tedious"" but generic steps of actually trying to clean the teeth and gums."
407,3,"Pub is nice.  For food, the breakfast was a bit overpriced (they called it brunch, but for $14, a breakfast like one you'd get at Denny's for $4.99).  I do not know why American hotels, esp. one in a hotel in a college town, do not do breakfasts in the European way...nice buffet, included in the price."
408,3,"I would give it a lower star rating, but it's late night status fed my nocturnal ass my first year in Berkeley. Everything sucks and is pretty gross aside from the Nachos. Those are okay. No, wait, it still sucks. It just sucks less. Still, it was good to have another alternative to Top Dog in the AM."
409,1,"This is a money-spinning dental practice, that I assume is staffed by dentists who need to pay off their enormous student loans while trying to live the lifestyle they expected when enrolling in dental school. I mean, let's face it...people don't go to dental school because they're passionate about scaring people. They want the pay day. Which is fine. But the problem I have is when dental practices recommend costly services that are unneeded, and who mislead you on how much it will cost in the end.

I went here because they accepted the cheaper Purdue Delta Dental insurance and offered 100% coverage for cleaning and x-rays. Sounds good. Unfortunately when I visited they refused to let the dentist see my teeth. Huh? An actual dental exam was not included since it was my first visit. What kind of garbage is that?? They claimed it was because they couldnt do a checkup because there was so much buildup on my teeth. I go to the dentist every 6 months and brush and floss daily. This is total crap. There was no visible buildup. 

They recommended a deep cleaning because my pits were in the 4-5 range on several molars. Well, sure the pits will show that deep when you friggin JAM THE PROBE INTO MY GUMS! No dentist has ever probed my teeth so aggressively. I guess they do it that way so they can have documentation for why they recommended expensive services...because remember, they offer cheap cleaning and x-rays so they have to get paid somewhere.

I bit on the deep cleaning, regrettably. I was told my insurance would cover some and I would owe something like $200. I had to come back for this appointment and again the dentist didnt even look at my teeth afterwards. What really pissed me off was they failed to previously mention that my insurance would partially cover this deep cleaning, but it would count as my second annual cleaning! So obviously next time I want my teeth cleaned in six months, I would pay out of pocket fully. Totally misleading on the price of this service.

I was not happy about any of this. I learned my lesson and I now go only to established dentists who are mid or late career. They are the only ones who have seen enough teeth and earned enough money to be objective about what services are really necessary and what ones are optional. They care about patients not about maximizing revenue. 

The hygenists and doctors don't seem like bad people and were pretty nice overall, but the actual dental work is far more important than being friendly. I would avoid this practice."
410,1,"went here for lunch in 2006.  saw a mouse running around the restaurant.  told the food server and her reply ""yeah, that happens all the time.""  no discount offered.  have not been back here for lunch since.  i did return for after work drinks one time, but otherwise i try to avoid this place."
411,3,"Admittedly much of what is offered at Whole Foods is well out of my price range. Though tantalizing, I'm not yet in the tax bracket where I can grocery shop there. However, I wandered over to Penguin's Cafe on one trip in hopes that I might be able to at least afford a quick lunch. Much the same as the rest of the store, what I found was priced at much more than I'd hoped to spend.

Penguin's offers a very nice variety of food from around the world, and even traditional favorites with fun spins. And if there's anything I'll splurge on, it's food. However, I've found everything that I've tried there to be average at best, and very overpriced.

This spot is convenient for hungry shoppers, and it does provide the same yuppie/hippie sort of atmosphere that I know draws many to the enclosed grocery. For me the cafe lacks the punch of the rest of the store, and hurts the wallet a bit more than it helps the stomach."
412,1,"This may be the best Indian restaurant in Princeton, but that is just commentary on Princeton's lack of good Indian restaurants.

I dined here last night with two friends, and I was thoroughly unimpressed with everything.  The decor, service, and portions are all completely out of proportion to the prices on the menu. There are security cameras in at least two corners of the very cafeteria-like dining room. At least 6 different staff people did something at our table; half of them gestured and muttered inaudibly from about 8 feet away, requiring us to say ""what?"" repeatedly. It was almost like candid camera. We were wondering if they were serious.

The Aloo Tikki Chaat with Chana Masala appetizer was a low pile of stewed chick peas that were allegedly poured over potato cakes, but the cakes were difficult to find (and taste). The chicken mulligatawny was essentially dal with chicken bits in it. The entrees my companions had were OK but nothing special, although the lamb meat in the biryani was good, and not fatty or connective-tissue-y. The plain nan was very unremarkable, without any hint of smoky char, flakiness, or richness.

I try to avoid complaining about portion sizes but I am unashamedly cost-conscious (translation: I don't have money to throw away). I am happy to pay for a little bit of something really good, but for big prices, Masala Grill provides only a little bit of something mediocre. For example the $7 mulligatawny was about the size of a cup of soup at a diner. Entrees were a similar rip-off based on where they landed on the quality-price continuum.

I can't imagine ever going here for a special occasion. In fact, I can't imagine ever going here again."
413,3,"Pizza with a side of pretentiousness?  Hells yeah!

OK, so in all fairness, the food is actually good.  I mean, I wouldn't have thought up potatoes + rosemary + pizza on my own, and I will pat the guy (or girl) that did on the head and give them a gold star.  But honestly, it is not rocket science that potatoes + anything else = awesome.  At least, they don't teach it at MIT.

Our Margherita-style pizza was maybe a bit drier and less flavorful than hoped, but it wasn't too bad, either.  (Probably just paled in comparison to potato pizza.  I know I did.)  Aside from the initial drink order and the pizza uuuunnnnnveiling (that pretentious, yes) our waitress kind of ignored us, though in all fairness, the place was kind of busy.

I think I'm dittoing other people when I say: it's gourmet pizza and worth a try if you want to deviate from the usual stuff.  But if you're looking for _pizza_ pizza, go for Pinocchios or something."
414,1,"I want to like this place but these are the reason why I don't and can't justify giving my business to them: 

1. They have a $10 minimum on card which is a lot of money if you're just popping in for a birthday card. 
2. Their cards are cute but overpriced. 
3. The sales people have never been friendly or helpful when I was there

Sorry, I'm taking my business elsewhere."
415,3,"There are two types of restaurants.  There are destination restaurants, where I'll go specifically for the food & experience - when I'm at one of these restaurants, the restaurant is the purpose of my outing.  Then there are utility restaurants, where the restaurant is just there to feed and host my friends and me while we're on a greater mission.  The food and atmosphere doesn't matter so much as the fact that they have a table for 20 with no reservation, are T accessible, and everyone can afford something off the menu.  Asgard is a utility restaurant.

To me the Asgard is a step up from a 99 and conveniently located right next to MIT.  The food is decent, the bar is decent, the décor is decent.  They have enough room for a large group.  You'll like it, and forget about it the moment you walk out the door.

I'm sure I'll be back..."
416,3,"Go to the concord one. The Berkeley YL STINKS 1) bad flavors, 2) bad toppings, 3) limited sample cups 4) slow refilling of the machines 5) stupid customers 6) cheesecake only rarely......"
417,1,"i wish i could give this place 5 stars for the staff, they're great. really great. 

that said, for $160+/night i was very unhappy. i understand that slo is a city in which there are only a handful of places to stay plus it was a holiday weekend so perhaps that contributed to the high price, but here are the non-price-related reasons i'll avoid this place (and possibly all super 8 motels anywhere) in the future... and to be fair, i've also included the good things:

pro: they saved our room for us even though we didn't check in until after midnight AND they were completely booked

con: our first room (#214 i think) was so gross we had to change rooms, plus it was 2 feet from the stairway so it was loud. the room smelled, the carpet actually FELT dirty to my not-super-sensitive feet - it almost felt coated in something vaguely sticky, the bathroom light wouldn't go on without the broken-sounding fan chunking away (even for that light that wasn't supposed to activate the fan), the screen was ripped so we couldn't leave the window open at night or while we were gone on a 95 degree day, and the sink had gross rusted stuff in it, as well as did the bed lights have rust all over them, also the bed (though probably clean) didn't earn my trust due to the other icky things

pro: the staff, really, can't say enough nice things about them. one guy even gave me a stamp to mail my really-late-last-minute card and he didn't let me pay him for it, and then he put the card in the mail for me! 

con: the second room, though much cleaner and nicer smelling, had an awful bed with pillows that were so old or low quality that they didn't even stay together (like you'd put your head on it and it would literally come apart into pieces within the pillow case)

pro: very close to everything in slo

con: the feeling like even though the rooms had been well cleaned, that it was just so icky that everything would have to be replaced to actually be clean

pro: decent parking, some covered

con: the pool is about 12 by 12 feet and only 3ish feet deep 

pro: the staff again, they were just so helpful and went out of their way to make changing rooms very easy

con: the price! oh my god the price! i would've been ok with this for $75/night max, but for $160+/night i've stayed in places with private hot tubs and balconies - and these places aren't in bad cities, one of them was even near slo!

pro: our shower in the second room was really clean and had a nice shower head 

con: the walls are SO thin you can hear everything. i mean everything. someone talking on the landing 30 feet away? yes.

so my overall conclusion, i was disappointed and very grossed out but i could've handled it if we hadn't been paying a mini-fortune for a frickin motel.


-"
418,3,"I have gone to Cafe Luna on two occasions and overall would give this place a 3.5 stars based on the items I have had from them. The first time I came to Cafe Luna, I ordered the specialty meatloaf melt .

The sandwich was very dry and and the combination of flavors did not mix well to me. Also, the meatloaf was very sweet--which could be from the ketchup commonly used for this dish, but I felt was a bit too much.

The most recent occasion, I ordered the specialty steak and cheese sandwich. The sandwich was very good overall--thinly slice beef, caramelized onions and gooey cheese all complimenting each other. That was the good. So what was the bad? The sandwich was not on a baguette as advertised, instead on a panini bread, and was very very greasy. I do not think that steak and cheese sandwiches should be this greasy.

***Complaints about service***
Also, the service was a bit mediocre. I head my steak and cheese order being completed and the sandwich maker calling for a completed order. It wasn't until 5 minutes later that I received my sandwich. This practice is unacceptable because service was slow on this day and people had already been served! 

Second complaint was that  my friend and I never received nor were asked whether we wanted water until we requested it--which was after we had been served food. Isn't the first rule when seating tables to give the customers utensils and ask them whether they wanted water? 

The decor and placement is very versatile-- good for enjoying food outside on a nice, sunny day but nice and enough spacing for dining indoors. Dare I say, a good place for a romantic lunch if the food wasn't so mediocre. Would've liked to try the breakfast that fellow Yelpers have been fussing about, but I do not think it's worth the money.

Overall, the decor, location, and atmosphere is good for a quick lunch in an area dotted with nothing but mediocre restaurants. This place is good if you're stuck in that area-- but that is not saying much. Very mediocre all-around."
419,2,"I'd hit up Fruity Yogurt the next time I'm craving some bubble tea but I will never eat their fro-yo again. It tastes like cough syrup poured into soft-serve.
A majority of the other yelpers seemed to like the fro-yo so maybe it's just my taste buds. If you do happen to like one of their flavors, they at least have loads of toppings to choose from."
420,1,This place has gotten worse over the years.  I really don't like the sushi here any more.  Its cheap and FISHY TOO.  I think they use low quality fish or just buy old cheap fish.
421,2,"Looks fancy, but up close full-on Monet! Stayed here for New Years.
Beds are hard as a rock!! feather Pillows and feather conformer saved me.
Shower looked like it hadn't been cleaned from previous guest! Gross! and little dust here and there. Overall looks nice and fancy, but they still have to work out all the details. OOOOhh and to top it all off. They ran out of breakfast and housekeeping lady came by at 10:30, knocked at our door and said checkout time!!! HELLO!! i wanna just make an excuse for them because it was a holiday, but they rrreally need to step up!"
422,2,"Yes, it's cheap.  And I love cheap.   Who doesn't love crappy greasy Chinese food?  It's great if you just want a quick place for lunch and are low on cash.  Free tea, and really quick service.  But, the food is just a tad too greasy and tasteless for me.  Maybe I'm spoiled now. For healthier options, try one of the soups with the steamed buns.  Those are pretty good and just as cheap really as any of the lunch specials."
423,3,"Chipotle meets Indian!  This place is something I would like to see more of.  I like Mexican food, but I love Indian.  Spice 6 lets you get Indian food as you like it with no wait.  

The only thing that prevents me from giving it a 4 star is the price.  I paid $11.60 for a lamb dish and a coke.  That's too expensive for me.  I'd rather find a good buffet, pay a few dollars more and eat until I am full!

I also am impressed with the growth of Hyattsville.  The reuse of the existing buildings with the addition of apartment/condo housing really invigorates this area.

It's worth a drive through to see what good urban development can do for an area."
424,2,"floppy pizza.

after waiting in line 30+ minutes, i was expecting some damn good pizza - or at least pizza i could pick up with my hands and eat.  instead i got soggy, floppy pizza that i had to eat with a knife and fork, like a jackass/donald trump.

i ordered the bianca - white pizza, with mushrooms, tomatoes and chicken. the guy behind the counter asked me ""is that all???"" and made me totally insecure about my selection before throwing like 4 little tomatoes, some chicken, and what can generously be described as a handful of mushrooms on there.

the pizza was tasty, but i guess i was expecting something a little more exciting, and they were extremely careful (read: stingy) with their ingredients.  

then there's the floppiness.  it just kind of ruined the whole experience.  and made a joke out of the name of the place, just asking me to put on my yelp review...

800 degrees? maybe they should turn it up to 850."
425,2,"I've eaten here maybe 2 x's, and each time I've left, regretting paying so much (well, it's not expensive, but dishing out any sort of money) for such 'meh' kind of food. The decor is nice, I guess- the tables are made of expensive glass from Europe, but the food is...again...meh. During one visit, the waitstaff was somewhat attentive, while the other time we were checked up on maybe once? Which maybe I would have excused if the restaurant was packed, but there was one other family in the restaurant, other than me and my SO. Also, I don't know if this has changed, but they played really loud music the other time I've been there."
426,2,Years ago this would be the place I'd love to go to for lunch or the game and sit in the car or go in. Now I don't even want to look at it. The meat for the burgers are so dry I could use it for sand paper. The Varsity has truly gone down hill. I don't know how people can eat this junk. Then again I am from LA and we have the best burger joint in the world In N Out.
427,2,"This review is based on our one visit not too long after they opened - it may be better now but we have not been desperate enough to try again. 
We were hopeful that Fabio's would be a good, local alternative for Italian food. There are lot's of options in the Albany area for Italian so if it is not good on our first visit you may not get back into our rotation.
Service was pretty slow even while the place was empty. The food was just OK and prices are high for what you get. The pizza that my wife had was on a cracker-like crust. Maybe some people like that style but we are not fans,especially when the price of a diner portion is high and all you get is an appetizer sized serving."
428,1,"I don't know why Al's always tricks me - it really feels like a place where you can find some gems. They blast loud music, don't give a fuck, and you feel filthy coming out of there, but in the end, it's all for nothing.

Now, I'm not asking that they have Jens Lekman CDs for me, but it'd be nice if they had something more obscure than Celine Dion or Gwen Stefani. It seems like the only music they get here is music that people have left in their dorms, or stole from frat parties for some quick cash.

That's not the worst of it though - not only do they only sell crap, but they sell it at higher prices than any other record store in the area. Who in their right mind would pay $7 for a used Whitney Houston CD?"
429,1,"I went here yesterday and received a TERRIBLE haircut. I'm seriously wearing a hat every time I go out, because I don't want people seeing my hair. He left my hair looking uneven, and my head now looks ""block-shaped."" I seriously don't understand how some people have given this place anything higher than a two. 

The guy is somewhat friendly though, and I had a decent conversation with him. However, he was finished in like 5 minutes. I had to take off my glasses for the haircut, but even before I put them on to look at myself, the blurry reflection in front of me pretty much told me how I looked= retarded. Crappy haircut, and $18 to top it off. F*ck. 

I hate giving the guy bad publicity, but he really does give terrible haircuts. I first thought it was convenient that there were no customers were I entered, but I soon found out why. I'm a Cal student, and I warn all other Cal students= DON'T COME HERE JUST BECAUSE IT'S CLOSE. You'll regret it. I did. 

Oh, and he has a little dog. Not really important, but I thought I'd mention it. I really, really, REALLY recommend that you don't come here. I only rated the guy a 1 because 0 wasn't an option."
430,2,"Um, hi, Moca? John here. Just a question: How come all three--THREE--times I've dropped by around 1:00 PM on the weekend for your weekend brunch which you claim begins at 11:00, you've been mopping the floors with all the chairs still stacked on the tables and told me to come back in 30 mins?

How come? Cuz your brunch menu sounds pretty awesome and I'd really like to plow through it face first.

Just, you know, wondering."
431,1,"Came in for advice, got a bad attitude.

I understand that it probably sucks working for Radio Shack, but at least be a decent human being. I hope these guys treat people better outside the workplace."
432,1,"I purchased a UCLA Recreation membership in order to join one of their tennis classes. I paid only $35 for the class, and over $200 for the membership. I got an email from the class instructor who said the class was cancelled due to low enrollment and I could get a refund.

I contacted with customer center and I was told I could get a refund for the class, but Recreation membership was not refundable. What a joke! They are refunding $35 but not the other $200.

I felt like I was being forced to use their services. How come can you take someone's money without providing them any services? Think one more time before purchasing UCLA Recreation membership for any class. In case class gets cancelled, you will be only refunded for the class price, not for the membership.

I was finally able to get the refund after filing a dispute through my bank, and contacting with Attorneys General. 

I received a call from them and they said I will get the full refund, but I won't be able to purchase UCLA Recreation membership again. They will pretty much put a note on my profile. What a big loss. 


I would highly recommend everyone to stay away from this place."
433,2,Not impressed AT ALL.  I could make a better cupcake out of a box.
434,2,"Hungry and exhausted after apartment hunting with my housemate, we decided to go somewhere nearby for some food. My housemate was craving for some pho, so we ended up ordering here.

I ordered their curry chicken over rice, and my housemate ordered the beef pho. The waiter was really nice, but I felt uncomfortable when I was looking at the menu near the register. Maybe because it was during winter break, and nobody was around, but I remember feeling like the waiter didn't want us to leave (I mean, it's a business, who wouldn't want customers?)

Anyway, when we got our food, we were really disappointed. My curry was really thick. It seemed as though there were more starch added in to the sauce to give that consistency than curry.  It wasn't as flavorful. I've tried WAY better curry chicken over rice dishes before.

My housemate, who's been to Vietnam and eat Vietnamese food daily, did not like their pho. She said it was bland, but they did give her a lot of noodles that she didn't finish eating.

Overall, the quality of the food wasn't worth the price and I probably wouldn't go back there again. 2 stars for good service though."
435,1,"I am in awe that this place continues to be in business. Every time I've been dragged here the food is cold and gross - I eat 2 bites and lose my appetite until I get home when I eat some cereal, or something less rancid. The prices don't justify any ""dish"" they serve. 

Yes it's open 24 hours but why not go to Fresh Grocer instead and buy a pint of Haagen Dazs and eat that? It'll be half the price and yes even half the regrets."
436,2,"either,

437,1,"After eating at Scholz's last night, my friend and I commented on the sausage we were waiting to digest.

""It was kind of... soft, wasn't it?"" I said.

""Yeah, definitely... loose,"" she replied.

I spent two hours this morning, from 5-7 a.m., wondering if I was going to barf or not. My best friend is STILL barfing almost 24 hours later. Although we're beginning to think she might have appendicitis, but only if her internal organs have somehow reversed themselves."
438,2,"After another disappointing meal, I've got to downgrade Grange.

The chicken and dumplings (appearing both on the Restaurant Week and regular menus) was bland as anything and desperately needed salt and pepper. Once I added them (they are not routinely available on the table and had to be obtained from a waitress), the dish was much improved. However, not even spices could save the dense and undercooked dumplings. In the dish's favor, it did include fresh and well-cooked veggies and tender chunks of chicken.

The potato and onion soup had a good texture but the smoky bacon flavor overwhelmed any potato or onion taste.

In fairness, I must say my dining companion really enjoyed his lamb and sausage dish, although he did comment that it was a rather small portion. He found the lamb perfectly cooked.

I remain a fan of the Grange's cocktails, and appreciate their Michigan beer selection more than ever now that I live out of state. In the future, Grange will be a drinks-only destination for me.

By the way, I'm still getting those emails."
439,1,"This place has gone downhill since it first opened.

First off, the service has been shotty and their menu has very little veggie options.  The only thing I can remember was the veggie curry (which was basically the S&B premade packet you can get at 99 ranch) or some rolls which were highly overpriced and small compared to Joshuya.

My friends and I usually came here for the karaoke when they had the huge big screen tv in the dining area which was free with the meal and you didn't actually have to pay to play (which didn't matter cause we bought up a storm of sake bombs anyways) but have heard since then they moved it and it isn't public anymore and you have to pay for it.

The regular sushi my friends tell me wasn't that great and its highly over priced.  There usually has only been 1-2 waitresses with too many people within the restraunt.  I'd rather just go to joshuya."
440,1,"Grimy, offering little of value to the scene."
441,1,"Even though I'm not a local (yet) I frequent the SLO area probably 4 times a year and over the years have visited Hands Gallery probably upwards of 50 times. They do have some cute stuff, but after my last visit I'm done spending money there due to the same problem many of the previous reviewers have mentioned - the attitude of the ladies who work there. I was in there last week, doing some shopping, looking in a jewelry case in the front of the store and I felt one of the blond ladies staring at me. I looked up, looked her right in the eyes and said a pleasant hello, mostly to try and alleviate the awkward tension of feeling watched. I received no response. Nothing. I shook my head and walked out, but was still fuming five minutes later so I walked back in and up to the counter where she was working with another woman behind the counter at the computer. It took her a good 20 seconds to look up from the computer at which point I said something to the effect of, I don't know if you're the owner (she said she wasn't), but I was just in here and looked directly at you and said hello and you couldn't be bothered to respond at all and I think it was incredibly rude. I've encountered this before here and heard it from a few other people as well. She said sorry and that maybe that was something they should work on but you know the saying it's 10% what you say and 90% how you say it? She didn't seem sorry and I don't think her demeanor will change. I am puzzled as to why the owner would continue to employ people who condescend to and alienate their customers."
442,2,"I love the sparse decor, it was very clean and the service was very friendly.  My bluefish sandwich was very fresh but bland.  The ciabatta bread was over-sauced with a just OK spicy aioli. I wish the hand-cut fries were bit more crisp and less greasy.  I also believe it is overpriced for the amount of food you get. No, I'm not comparing it to fast-food portions, but other similar establishments."
443,1,"donut was ok, round rock donuts are the best, dunkin donuts n krispy kreme r better than ken's. my car got scraped up pretty bad trying to park in front of the building. there is a huge, very deep ditch in front of the parking spaces. who thought a moat was appropriate for a donut shop? i thought they were designed for medieval castles!? i will never go back to ken's!"
444,1,"Please listen to all the reviews.  My husband and I chose not to, but wish we had.  The minute you walk in, I was flooded with the memories of college house parties.  The floor WREAKED of booze, pungent, old booze.  Yuck! 

There was absolutely no one in the ""dining room"" so we opted to sit at the bar.  Big mistake.  The bartender did get our first round of drinks, but it took forever to get our orders taken.  Hint: if you see people with BOTH menus closed because take that as a sign that people are ready to order!

As a plus the spinach and artichoke dip was extremely tasty.  

We ordered salads.  I asked mine for dressing on the side, extra onions.  I got neither.  My husband got bleu cheese dressing and was given a vinaigrette.  His was a side salad, so it came out first.  When the waitress gave him the wrong salad, he politely explained we wanted bleu cheese.  She looked at him as if he was wrong and walked away.  A new waitress came over to give us the correct salad.

We weren't even done with our appetizer when my meal arrived, which irks me.  Salad and soup.  Like I said before, my salad did not come out the way I wanted, I mean seriously if you cannot remember people's orders PLEASE WRITE THEM DOWN.  I realized it was a lost cause and didn't bother asking for onions or pointing out that I wanted dressing on the side. 

We finished the app, I had my meal out, but no sign on my husband's food.  I began to eat because I figured his would be on the way soon.

Yeah, soon turned into 25 minutes!!  He eventually went over to the bartender and asked about his meal.  5 minutes later he came over to say there was a mix up in the kitchen, which he should have informed us BEFORE my husband had to inquiry.  On top of this no apology, just informed us and walked away.

 His meal was tasty, but was it worth the wait?  No.

Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. 

Boo."
445,2,"We stayed here because my wife went to school here in the 80's.  As fun as it is to go for the nostalgic angle, this hotel let me down in every aspect.  Don't know where to begin, so I will leave it at this:

If you want a great location but do not care about things like water pressure, concierge, bell hops, parking, food, clean ice buckets, water pressure, bed bugs, price, water pressure, price, electrical outlets to plug in your stuff,  setting your own temperature in your room...  you get the idea.

Could be great, but whoever is responsible for the hotel operation has obviously decided not to make it so.   Shame really.  Never again, try the Bell Tower Hotel half a block away for an actual ""Hotel"" experience.

Go Blue"
446,2,"The ambiance in this place isn't bad and neither is the food.  But that's the problem.  Their food is pretty average and not something I'd expect from a restaurant.  I could throw together their curries easily enough at home.  When you add in the difficulty of finding a place to park in Squirrel Hill and how crowded it can get, I would suggest eating elsewhere.  If you want amazing Thai food maybe go to Bloomfield instead."
447,2,"The drinks here are nothing to rave about, except for their watermelon slush thing they have, since they blend in real watermelon chunks in the tea. I studied there today for a few hours, and I've decided that I probably won't be back there again to do work. Although you can study there for as long as you want and use the free internet...

1. The place gets so stuffy bc they don't have AC and don't turn on their fans.

2. I was told to put my Kirkland brand water bottle away bc they don't 
allow outside drinks (even though I had bought a large drink from them).

3. They ran out of boba today.. I guess it happens, but it just seems like they should plan ahead right? 

I wish Fantasia, Ten Ren's, or Au 79 would open up in Westwood, since they have better quality milk teas and boba. I've realized I'm probably complaining right now because the guy working there made me put my water bottle away :'("
448,2,Average food and below average service. Just been there once but will give it a second try.
449,2,"I wouldn't come here if I had other options at a given time. However, they prey on the captive CU audience and I occasionally fall victim. If you need a pen, highlighter, or binder in a pinch, Ivy League Stationers will have what you need. Unfortunately, it will cost about 100% more than Duane Reade or Staples. Annoying."
450,1,"WHATEVER YOU DO, NEVER EVER BUY AN APPLIANCE FROM BEST BUY!!!!!!! Please, listen to my story and go ANYWHERE else to buy a major appliance. 
In May of 2008 I purchased a new washer and dryer for $2,000. The dryer's automatic cycle never worked properly, it would run forever and ever, never turning off when the clothes were dry. Having purchased the repair and replacement plan for an extra $250, I called immediately to have the unit replaced. Well, flash-forward to one year later, I have taken approx. 10 days off work to have repair people come out and the dryer STILL does not work properly. The last Geek Squad repair man who came to my home insinuated that I was lying about the problem and that there was nothing wrong with my dryer. My gas bill says otherwise! After the last ""repair"" I left my home with the dryer on and it ran for 3 HOURS!!! I have spent countless hours on the phone with ""customer service,"" a poorly named division of this company, and everyone I speak to is completely unwilling to help me with this situation in any way. A supervisor name Terry in Montana just told me that I have to basically continue having these useless service calls, even though the last repair man was  borderline verbally abusive to me in my own home. And here I am, one year later stuck with a 1,000 dollar dryer that never worked right.

Made no difference to these charming young men. Upon that news they seemed to get a little more indignant and eternally unhelpful.  More than once now they told me on the phone they could help me then after driving 15 minutes late at night to bring them a project they quickly dismissed me and said (something one might think simple) is impossible with no apology, empathy, suggestion of a solution or even just a reason why.

The layout is the worst. We were seated at a table with another group way too close to the bar and the door, so people kept pushing past us as we tried to eat. One group of guys actually leaned on our table while they watched the game. It was awful and staff never made them move! 

One star, and I don't think this place deserves a second chance. Sucks too, because the staff there, for the most part, weren't that bad."
456,2,"I don't get the hype over Sprinkles Cupcakes. The cupcakes look delicious, but the frosting is way too sweet for my taste."
457,2,"I came here for lunch during DineLA and I have to say... it was... ehhhh. I mean for the area and the price, the portions were huge! But even if the portions were big it doesn't make up for the lack of flavor. The blue chip tortilla appetizer was pretty good, but the bed of salad that it sat on top of was not very fresh... The onion rings were HUGE, but the batter was nothing special. I ordered the margarita pizza and although it was filling, it was really plain and lacked FLAVOR. My friend ordered the burger and it was just messy. However, I do have to say that the bacon on the burger were really thick slices and SOOO DELICIOUS! 

I doubt I would come back again given the prices and the food..."
458,2,"Nice, clean store, but unfriendly staff.  Not helpful for beginner getting into medium format film.  I feel like any specialty photo store should be delighted to see young people getting into film photography and learning.  This was not the case.  Perhaps where I grew up we value a friendly, encouraging attitude far more, but regardless, I left feeling discouraged rather than encouraged.  Limited selection of 120m film, but that is to be expected.  Hopefully the prints turn out nicely."
459,1,"This place is deliberately hiding their horrible rating from the health department. They got a C. If you're not from New York, I'll just tell you that Cs are VERY RARE. And it makes it worse that they are deliberately hiding their rating, i.e. not displaying it in the window.

460,1,"The honor of my first one star review goes to this place. 

I showed up for a late lunch and was greeted by no one. After ordering with the cook, I sat down and 10 minutes later, a waiter comes by to ask if I'd like a drink. I waited 30 minutes for food. I was completely ignored. 

I was just about to leave $2 for my coke and walk out when my food came. The jerk chicken was salty with no other flavor. The ""slaw"" was bland and very tough. And the rice was dry and tasteless. 

One of the worst meals ever."
461,2,"The beer selection here is pretty much the same as at every other bar in the area, and the ambiance is a bit wanting. Its annoying that when the place is crowded, you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the bar. 

I've eaten here once, and wasn't impressed by the food, but that was several years ago. I'm surprised that its still here."
462,2,"I'm totally unimpressed by them. This was my first time hopping on one of their trains, and almost everything that could've gone wrong did go wrong.
- First, their kiosks wouldn't work at the 30th St. station, so couldn't get the tickets electronically.
- Then, when we approached the counter, the system was down, so they had to hand write the tickets.
- Also, they weren't able to accept plastic, only cash.
- Finally, the train was 50 minutes late.

I'm like what the f*ck? But my roomy, who travels with them pretty regularly, tells me that today was definitely an anamoly, and they're usually quite solid. So two stars for that. I have yet to see it though...

- And yeah, the stewardess lady was sooo friggin' loud, annoying as hell!"
463,1,"OK, have given this place a couple chances now, and it's unbelievable how bad it is, CONSISTENTLY.  

Granted, they make good steak fries, but it's a JEWISH DELI (supposedly famous).  

This most recent time, I had a Reuben.  A staple, right?  Cold, stale bread, a decent stack of meat, bland and dry.  Honestly, the worst Reuben I've had, ever, at any place, Jewish deli or not.  

Oh, and I had the pleasure of paying THIRTEEN DOLLARS for a lousy sandwich and fries.  

Seriously, this place just doesn't cut it.  I can't understand why they stay in business, looking at the Yelp ratings for it and it's sister restaurants."
464,1,"My review is specifically about the optical portion of the Tang Center.

I had an eye exam by an optometrist--who also teaches in the School of Optometry at Berkeley--a couple blocks away from where I live a few days ago.  I thought I'd save myself a trip to campus and pay out of pocket for the exam, then use my entire insurance allowance from SHIP for contact lenses at the Tang Center.

The exam was at the very end of January and yesterday I went into the Tang Center, prescription in hand, to order my contacts.  I was informed that, for liability reasons, they would not fill prescriptions from outside optometrists.  I was told I'd need to pay for an eye exam and contact fitting at the Tang Center, even though I'd just had one ca. three days prior, and by one of their own teachers.  There are entire businesses based off of filling outside contact lens prescriptions, but they can't do it for a client who met with a goddam teacher at their own school?

None of this is mentioned on their website as of this writing, and the pricing on the website is at least partially inaccurate, so be sure and call or find out in person.

tldr: They don't fill optical prescriptions unless you get your eyes examined by them.  And I heard the employees hire day laborers just to choke them in the shower."
465,2,"I used to go here all the time when I was a teenager. I remember the surrounding area as well to be a lot more upscale. The pastries are delicious, and the coffee is good, however now that I have gone back I see that the place is missing something. I usually go in the mornings for coffee and a bite to eat, but it is a total turn off to see homeless people and shifty folks eating inside. There always seems to be one woman who tried to take money from the tip jar, and she harasses people inside the cafe as they are eating. It makes for a very uncomfortable experience. 

The regular drip coffee is quite delicious though. Food is good, but atmosphere wise it is missing that ambiance it once had. In the mornings they sometimes show the news on the tv inside, but they really should play some festive music. Also, there are way too many people setting up their office spaces in the most desirable spots by the window. If I want to have a 10 minute sit down with a coffee and croissant, I know that I most likely will have to sit in the back towards the restroom and deserted seating area. That is a total bummer. 

Some of the young ladies who work there are very nice and attentive, however I was dissapointed that not one person there let me know that they can bring my order to my table. I order several plates including coffee for me and the person I was with. I ordered it for ""here"" and they watched as I struggled to walk back and fourth to my table trying not to drop something or spill my coffee. Also, when I did order my coffee, one of the not so pleasant women working there, filled the cup to the brim and by the time I sat down, the saucer was filled with coffee. Perhaps more hospitable employees would make for a better experience.  Although, some are very nice, I guess it just depends on when you go. 

I would surely go again, but I wish the cafe was meant for that, a cafe. Those people setting up shop with their Mac books and everything else should go to Starbucks and leave those that want to truly enjoy their coffee with the window seat. :)"
466,2,"I decided to move off campus my second year to live at Trieste.

Probably the biggest mistake of my young life thus far. 

First and foremost, they lied to me and my roommates by telling us that we were going to get the same apartment as the one they had showed us--which was considerably remodeled and in the more desirable sections of the complex-- but were later dumped in a low rent version of what we had seen. Pretty gross.

The biggest problem with the particular apartment that we were obliged to lease was that it was in a corner where light seems to never penetrate. So if you're considering living here, I highly suggest you make sure what apartment you're getting so you don't get left with the short end of the stick. 

The walls are paper thin so noise travels really far really quick. I received about 4-5 noise complaints over the course of half a year because apparently, a party of 4-5 is too much of a rager for Trieste walls to handle. Living room is also retarded because its slanted on all corners so you cant really fix your furniture to maximize space. With that being said, the apartment is pretty small especially for the price. 

Parking is terrible here because you only get two spots for each apartment and street parking is shared by about five other residential neighborhoods in the area. So after 5pm, you wont be able to entertain guests without having to make them endure a frustrating journey around the entire block a few times (a many few) before finding a spot

I've never had many problems with the leasing office other than the few noise complaints I received but they weren't exactly the most helpful group of individuals either. They're kinda more concerned with the older people that live there and less responsive to the younger college kids.

The only things that makes Trieste ""eh"" and not ""eek!"" is that its location. 
It's right in the middle of both the Nobel and Arriba shuttle stops so it allows students to get to class pretty efficiently because you can choose either depending on the time of the day and traffic hours. 

Overall, definitely not a place I'd like to live for more than a few months. Way better complexes and options out there."
467,2,Not very helpful or knowledgeable on their products. I prefer shopping at sephora.com.
468,1,"This coffee bean sucks!!!  My drink wasn't even mixed when I got it, the vanilla was all clumped at the bottom.  Plus, she forgot about my bagel and I ended up having to wait for like 10 other people to get rung up before I got it.  Yes it's in a convenient location, but I'd rather drive somewhere else then deal with such incompetence again."
469,2,"I really can't understand why the heck this place has such good reviews. My experience here was awful! The only positive thing about the place was the hostess, who was very nice and seated us out on the patio when we requested and closed the windows to keep it from being too cold.

I ordered a shrimp tempura roll for $8.75 and got 4 pieces (although I will say they were bigger than normal)--what a rip off! Totally not worth the money! It also looked very dry--nothing like what Ami Sushi, where they drizzle some eel sauce over it--and had weird things in it like asparagus and lacked good stuff like avocado. As a result, I had to ask for some spicy orange mayo if I had any hope of enjoying it. The waitress said it would cost $1 and I bitterly agreed, but she never even brought the damn thing!!! My friend got so annoyed that she went to the hostess (again, the only positive aspect of the entire restaurant) and asked for it, after which it was immediately delivered. The waitress never returned to say sorry or anything--she only cleaned up the dishes and gave us the check.

One of my friends that had come with me ordered a combo with teriyaki chicken and katsu chicken. The teriyaki chicken wasn't even teriyaki chicken--it was basically grilled chicken with teriyaki sauce on the side for you to dip it in. The katsu chicken was equally as unappetizing. She barely ate any of it.

The other friend that had come with us was the only fortunate one. She ordered a spicy tuna crunch roll for around $7 and this one was good! And it had 6 or 8 pieces, so it was much more reasonably priced.

We were so angry with the poor service and mostly bad food, we left only $0.54 of tip--and that was only because I wanted to make the charge on my credit card a round number!

DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND! If you're looking for a good sushi place in Westwood, check out Ami Sushi!!!"
470,1,"I would not go back to this place. The tea is cinnamon, but much to strong.  I didn't find the food to be that great.  The free blueberry cake might be a draw for some folks, but it was just average.  The coffee is not that great either.  I don't like the decor.  The Creamery on Emerson or at the Stanford mall is better."
471,2,"So I used to love this place.  
When i had a negative experience here, i had been a customer for 8 plus years and had always been kind, tipped well, etc.  Anyway, i went in one day with a friend of mine to have some lunch. I ordered some food and he decided to hold off for a second, realizing that he had forgotten that he had somewhere to be.  When i was the only one that ordered, the waiter got pissed off and was super rude, and then a woman that worked there told me that i could stay and eat, but that i would have to leave as soon as i was done.  WTF?  It was completely ridiculous.  We tried in vain to kindly and calmly explain the situation but to no avail.  I cancelled my order to the delight of the staff and left and haven't been back since.  It was just an insane experience, like the staff were just waiting for somebody to react to.  I was really upset after this all happened because i had literally NO idea what we did wrong. So unfortunately, i dont go there anymore, which sucks because the food is pretty decent and well priced."
472,2,"Eating here made me realize that I do not like authentic Thai food.  First one star for the cool menu and another star for the cool cook...he's awesome - you need to watch his every move...he does not waste a second of his cooking time.

So why didn't I like this place?  Well, I do not think that basil and broccoli belongs in Fried Rice....who does that?  I guess that's how most authentic Thai places cook their fried rice too (as my friend had informed me).  I also had the soup, forgot the name - but it had chicken in some coconut broth...I thought that was ok.  This place is really small...probably only have 5 or 6 tables and 8 stools at the cook area.  I'm glad we did not have to wait because if we did, I would've been more disappointed.  This place sounds like it gets busy during lunch time (according to the Yelpers) so come around 2:30.  Another reason why I only gave this place two stars is because the waitress couldn't accommodate my receipt request...I wanted a separate check (for my expense report for work) and she could not do it for me...it's not like they have those fancy receipt things...it was one of those green padded guest check receipts!!! WTF...

By the way - parking sucks too...it's on the street and you must pay!"
473,2,i had the chicken fajita plate and the salt level was too much to handle - just too much salt in the beans and chicken.  food would have been much tastier with less salt.
474,2,"I was very disappointed with the food and drink.  I had a pina colada and a mojito and neither were any good.  the bread are okay only.  They should at least keep them warm.  Salad was horrible.  It was like eating rabbit food.  No taste to it at all.  The hubby and I both got steak and potatoes leek shoestrings.  Mine was a bit overcook.  His was medium and look very juicy, but chewy.

For such a nice restaurant, I was expecting at the very least decent food. 

The ambiance and the decor is very nice, and valet parking cost is not bad at all.  Very good customer service.  Hence the two stars."
475,2,"Fast and convenient, but not good.

Let's start with what's good. They give a 20% to Cal students! Their jasmine green milk tea is a winner. It smells so good and tastes just as it smells. It's not watered down like at other places. I have also heard that their pho is decent in comparison to other places around campus.

Onward to the bad. The Viet sandwiches here are NOT good. I tried it after my Viet friend told me that it was good, but I was disappointed. It was so sweet, and I had to drench it in sriracha. I decided to give this place another try when they had a munch on me deal for their shrimp and chicken salad. The salad was fresh, but there was something missing. The dressing that they put on it didn't complement the shrimp and chicken very well and I had to ask for extra to even taste it. It's so liquidy that all the dressing ends up going to the bottom. It doesn't stick to anything, so you end up with a pool of dressing when you finish eating the bare lettuce.

Sigh. I wish this place was better, so that I could fulfill my cravings for a legit Viet sandwich."
476,2,"I read the reviews and went anyway, because I was meeting some friends I don't get to see very often, and I would have gone to Chez Cat Food. Maybe if we had, the food would have been better. The bread was stale, the ""salad"" was soaked in ""dressing."" I had some serious doubts about whether the cheese was being recycled into different pots. Don't get me started on the wine. 

Now, the chocolate fondue? That's a different story. Strawberry marshmallows and fresh fruit! Bring it on!"
477,2,"Good lord, either you all need to get a grip or I just am really unlucky that I got the only bad pizza at Antico. Got a take-away last night and am rating on it because let's face it, its a take-away joint, not a proper restaurant at all. So I was expecting a good pizza when I got home about 10 minutes after receiving the pizza. Don't you love the new 14th Street Bridge? My roomie was waiting to use my car to take a date out and they both really complained about the smell. It was in fact very strong of garlic. Now I love me some garlic, but this pizza had fairly large and fairly raw bits all over. Shouldn't that 1000 degree oven have cooked it a bit? As for the crust, again I normally eat the entire crust on a good pizza, but the edgy bit that should have been bready was really hard. Not like stone, but not like bread either, more like 'clamp your teeth down hard on one end and pull real hard on the other to get a bite' hard. As for flavor, I think the two stars says it all: ""meh"".
Worst of all, I have had Columbus' Revenge all day and it was either that pizza or a bowl of pasta I had for lunch. Now, I'm not saying it was, but it was. The 2 pieces I saved for lunch went in the bin. Its really expensive pizza and I was going to try to get my moneys worth. As long as I am on a roll here, the girl that tried to claim my pizza because she couldn't remember what she ordered really annoyed me. And did anyone else notice the suits that screamed The Godfather and made me very nervous? (Suits meaning older, thicker-set Italian guys in suits.) Yikes!"
478,1,"everytime i go by this place theres either emo kids, goth kids or people with different sexual orientations than my own and unfortunately i dont fit into the categories so im just not sure i could get any use out of this club"
479,2,"Like said before..I want to love this place..BUT
I came in for a light lunch and had to choose from three sandwiches and a burger, chose the grass fed burger (big sign outside). the burger was close to $10 so  I opted out of the extra cost for cheese. I was somewhat shocked to get one slice of  toasted bread cut in half and  with a nicely cooked hamburg in between, two small pieces of lattice raw onion and slice of pickle on the side. The meat was good but the greasy toast left a bad taste in my mouth and a whole in my wallet."
480,2,"Cheap sushi rolls, Decent food, Passable Service, but Funny Smells, Annoying Techno Music and way too loud and crazy. 

The restaurant is a remodeled church, with strange decor. Longish wait but seems immensely popular with the local college crowd for their Happy Hour prices from 5 PM until closing at 10.

Not so great: Screaming arguments with your wait staff? Young waiters drinking with the customers while working? Then being sloppy by spilling the sake bomb all over the table and your customers?   Serving under-aged college kids in miniskirts and funny bunny ears? Not cool.

If it's late and you need a bite to eat, go ahead-probably better suited for late night snacking with your buddies, but a bit too much for my tastes."
481,1,Avoid totally. We are a good customer and a superior tipper and since the recent changes this place has went to hell. Today consisted of calling and being put on hold for 10 minutes then hung up on. Called back and was told that it was the credit card machine. Mind you i heard the girl talking to the cook the whole time while i waited. Not the first time this has happened recently. we will avoid and so should you .
482,1,"I've been meaning to write a review about Giuseppe's SLO since our awful dinner experience here on Valentine's Day.

As a CalPoly alumni, I once spent too much time and waaaay too much $$ at Giuseppe's in Pismo, but I don't regret it. The food there was great and the knowledgeable servers sparked my interest in wine.

So it was with great anticipation that I took my boyfriend to the ""Palazzo"" version for Valentine's Day (we spent Valentine's Day weekend in SLO - I think he'll never come back with me because of all my reminiscing).

Table: we were quickly seated at a good table; we had had reservations 5 weeks in advance.

Drinks: waitress didn't know what a Manhattan was. Say what? Drinks were extremely slow to come out.

Ordering: we told the waitress we like dry Italian wines and Malbecs, nothing fruity. Did she have any suggestions? Answer:

""Oh, um, I'm only 20 so I don't know anything about the wines. Let me go ask the bartender.""

What!? Out of all the undergrads and graduate students and other people desperate for jobs who are OVER 21, you hired a 20 yr. old who by definition will be entirely blank when it comes to the (arguably) most important part of dinner?? I'm no service snob but I was appalled. 

She was gone for over 10 minutes. The wine that was recommended I could have paid $15 for at Trader Joe's; it was OK, but terrible at $60+.

Food: Trying to get close to the amazing ""lover's plate"" (bacon wrapped prawns over the butternut squash ravioli) that they used to serve at the Pismo location, I ordered the butternut squash ravioli. My boyfriend ordered pasta - I forget which. But my dish must have been ready way before his, because when it hit our table, the sauce was congealed and the raviolis cold. They were pretty awful.

My boyfriend said his pasta was mediocre - I didn't try it. 

Dessert: I'll usually do a port, but decided not to risk it with Ms. Underage. The one bright spot is that the bartender still makes up the ""Flatliner"" cocktail - a mixture of espresso, frangelico, vodka, and 151 that'll get you humming, but it's not cheap. I ordered this and it helped - a little.

This was supposed to be my treat to my boyfriend, as someone who had picked up way too much slack for his out-of-work girlfriend lately, and I am so disappointed that I wasted my money here. Such a shame."
483,2,"I just finished a Reuben Went Veggie sandwich from Beantowne Coffee House. The atmosphere was nice and the staff quite friendly but, the sandwich was by no stretch of the imagination a $7 sandwich. 

The description indicated that there was 'avocado' in the sandwich (I'm not sure why there was 'avocado' in a Reuben). In this case 'avocado' did not mean slices of avocado but a sweet salt and vinegar dressing that may have been thickened and colored with avocados. There was no avocado flavor at all.

Otherwise the sandwich was fairly mundane and probably worth almost $5. The marble rye was tasty as were the cabbage and tomatoes."
484,2,"I brought 3 cupcakes yesturday @ Oakland. I tried the Red velvet, salted caramel and tiramisu flavors. Cupcakes are ok, but $3.00 per cupecake is kind of over price. I think the cupcakes @ nobhill taste alot better and is cheaper. For first time ok, will I try again? No."
485,2,"My visit to Hunt's was actually kind of hilarious. I came in for items to resurrect a 1970s SLR: batteries and film. The salesman, whom I had to interrupt as he was chatting aimlessly about lens hoods with the only other customer in the store, a guy with an enormous Canon around his neck who seemed to be affixed to the side of the counter, unexpressively told me what kind of batteries I needed. Pushing my luck, I asked him for some rolls of Fujicolor. ""Sure,"" he said as though I had suggested we eat catfood, ""Why not."" I realize film's not the latest craze out there, but I'm not an idiot for shooting it or purchasing it from you. At least I don't think so."
486,1,"Please do not send your child to Rosewood Oaks. My daughter went to Rosewood Oaks for under a year. They have a handful (as in fewer than 5) dedicated, wonderful, amazing employees. These few ladies really care about the kids and take great care of them. Everyone else, including the owner, are negligent in their disregard for the wellbeing of the children in their care.
They have an unacceptably high turnover rate and are constantly transferring teachers to different rooms, often for very flimsy, ridiculous reasons so children have no consistency of care. It happened frequently that i would go to pick up my daughter and not know who the person caring for her even was. Usually I had never seen them before.
When I picked my daughter up after 5pm, she was almost guaranteed to be strapped into their giant stroller, a ""bye bye buggy"" with a dirty diaper. This means my child had already been strapped into a chair, unable to run around, ahead of being placed in her carseat for our drive home. She was usually screaming by the time we got home because she had not had nearly enough exercise during her day.
The management of Rosewood refuses to place notices on the doors to classrooms when a child gets sick, causing disease to travel much further than necessary. My daughter was sick more days than she was well while attending this facility, and it happened several times that she was noticeably ill when I went to pick her up at the end of the day. Despite my request that they call me even if she seemed ""off,"" they refused to do so.
These were my main issues with this daycare, although there were many other worrisome issues that I witnessed. In short yes, it's cheap and convenient, but it is not worth it. Save a couple hundred dollars elsewhere and put your child anywhere else but here. You'll be glad you did. I know I am!"
487,2,"I've never done an update of a review before, but this is the first time my opinion of a place has so drastically changed. I hate to sound like an old fart, but it's gone downhill. It's kind of embarrassing for me that I pointed so many people to this place.

I've gone to D&B many times since I last reviewed it. The last few times in a row though have been huge disappointments. On my most recent trip, our small water glasses were filled only when we sat down. We ordered drinks right away and got them. But after an appetizer and our main meal, our water was never refilled and we were never asked if we wanted another drink. When we got our salad, the waitress turned and walked away immediately so I could barely ask for an extra plate. Luckily she heard me and turned around. We also ordered the mushroom crepe noodle deal and got steak instead. I ended up eating it anyway because like I said, the waitress never came back. I went with the intent to get more drinks and cupcakes too but we were left waiting so long, I was not in the mood. 

This experience was exactly what has happened the last few times I've gone - ignored, no water refills, left before I originally intended to. Unfortunately it's to the point where I can't go there anymore. I guess it's still a good place if you're meeting up for drinks during late night and you don't need attentiveness. What a shame! The food is still good. It takes a lot for me to shun a place just on service, and I thought my service standards are kinda low."
488,1,"I really wanted to buy a bike from these guys, despite the inattentive and sruly service I had received years ago.   In fact I knew what I wanted to buy and just needed to place the order.  After 15 minutes of waiting with zero recognition from the staff I finally had to walk out.  There are better bikes shops in the area."
489,2,"I used to go to this place all the time in high school. It was expensive then and its expensive now. The breakfast was always decent and the appetizers and sandwiches are ok. This time I got a bowl of French Onion soup which I had remembered liking in the past. Now I don't know if my taste buds have gotten more refined or they were having an off day but this was the worst soup I've ever had out. The ""broth"" was so light it tasted like water. My Monte Cristo was full of meat but still on the bland side and not what I remembered. With tax and tip I ended up paying $20. Way too much for the quality of food. Our waitress was trying to being funny and friendly but just came off as really annoying. Unless you have no other options I suggest you avoid at all costs."
490,2,"Came here for dinner last night.

This was my first visit... and probably my last...
food was OKAY. 
I had...
+ shitake mushroom
+ tofu
+ salmon
+ shrimp
+shrimp tempura
+ crunchy roll
+ chicken wings
+ corn

Yes, happy hour is nice, but you get what you pay for.

Great place to come with friends for dinner. There was a 10 wait with no reservation.
Love the building inside and outside.
Parking is free late at night if you're lucky to find an open spot.

I won't be back. sorry, food didn't leave me wanting to come back for more."
491,1,"What a huge disappointment this place was. After reading the Yelp reviews, it was like I ate ate a completely different place. We went for lunch this past Monday. It was so bad we couldn't eat our food. We left out of there feeling robbed. Here's the run down: brisket was bland, shredded beef tasted like it had been reheated way too many times, pork had an odd taste (like it was turning bad), macaroni and cheese dried out, potato salad consisted of mostly celery, and beans were flavorless. I cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this place. Hands down the worst BBQ I've ever had."
492,1,"The food is over priced. If you want to spend over $40 for a couple of appetizers and a beer five seasons has you covered. I got calamari. It was pretty standard calamari. I also got egg rolls which should have been at a tapas place for about $3 because that's how much food it was. Nothing about it impressed me. They allegedly had alligator in them. They could have bought frozen egg rolls from wal mart and put one and a half on a plate and slapped an outrageous price on it and I wouldn't have known any different.
Their roof top is never open. I drive by this place almost every day and have never seen anyone sitting up there. The one time I went the people beside us were complaining that the only reason they came was for the roof top and it was closed. I don't understand why anyone would come here unless you wanted to see how many different kinds of animals you could eat in one meal because that's kind of their thing other than the beer brewing."
493,1,"Came here on a whim and boy, was that a mistake!  Should have definitely stuck with Asian Ghetto across the street.  The food was not impressive at all and service was completely terrible (not because they were rude, but because the waitresses were completely clueless and had absolutely no idea what was going on!).  

Sat down and after over thirty minutes, none of the waitresses ever came over to check on us and ask for our order.  One of them finally came after we waved her down.  Service here is completely disorganized, almost every time I looked up, there was at least one waiter or waitress frantically running around or looking utterly confused!  Seemed like there was no system for them to tell which tables were waiting to be served or still waiting to order, and the staff seemed completely untrained and had no experience working in service before. 

I ordered the mixed beef soup and the food finally came after a long wait -- but without the rice!  The waitress said they would bring it right away but then came back and said that they had run out of rice and it would take a few minutes for it to finish cooking.. WTF?  What Asian restaurant runs out of rice??  We proceeded to eat the soup without rice and was completely not impressed with the food either.  Meat was not fresh and was obviously made from frozen beef and there were only a few strands of soggy noodles in my soup!  I was almost done with the soup and the rice still had not arrived after over thirty minutes -- either it was still cooking or the waitress had completely forgotten about it.  Turned out it was the latter, and after asking another waitress, we finally got our rice but were almost done with the meal by then.  

There was actually a decent stream of customers coming in giving that the restaurant is still new, but many tables were also looking displeased and suffering long waits.  Given the completely disorganized service and poor quality of the food (I just hope I don't get food poisoning....), the place really needs to make some drastic improvements or it will go out of business in a few months :(  will not be coming back again."
494,1,"Yuk! This bar stinks. I went here once because some friends wanted to go dance. I couldn't drink any alcohol because of some medicine I was on at the time.

Note: NOT A GOOD PLACE TO GO IF YOU CAN'T DRINK.

In any event, there's not really anywhere to stand that isn't in the way of the meathead bouncers. Well, aside from standing next to some button -shirt, tucked-in, balding, sweaty middle-agers that were lurking and jabbing each other in the ribs in regards to all the nubile young lasses undulating and preening to the shitty dance music. And let's not forget to mention all the douchebag college students that were there that night.

And, strangely, two different people came in on wheelchairs and left right away cause, like I said, there's not really anywhere to stand or sit as the case may be.

But... this could have been an anomaly since it was a Friday night or something."
495,1,"Since we're from out-of-town, I asked my son to pick a nice restaurant for us to take him and his friends out to celebrate their graduation.  I turned down several of his choices because I didn't think they were worthy of such a special occasion.  When he told me about Gandy Dancer, it sounded just perfect, with its charming setting in an old stone train station, with big glass windows overlooking a gorgeous garden, and top-notch food, so I agreed with his choice.  Well, when the big day came, we were all looking forward to experiencing the ambiance and having a nice meal, so, when we were hearded into what seemed to be a walkway between the main dining area and the gorgeous garden area, we all looked at each other in disappointment and asked to be moved, especially because quarters were very tight and we were extremely uncomfortable, but we were told ""no, I can't, sorry.""  So, there we were, one of two large tables shoved into a small walkway area, trying to make the best of it, putting pocketbooks and gifts into a small corner against the wall to keep them out of the way.  Little did we know, there would be no room to serve, and the waitress would soon trample them, while squeezing into the corner and rudely  leaning over us, despite our best efforts to keep them safe.  Nor did we know that when people were being led to that nice area overlooking the gardens, that their buttocks would push into our chairs as they were trying to squeeze by, mercilessly jostling us every time we tried to take a bite of our mediocre food.  If I had know that, after ordering our wine, the waitress would confrontationally stand over us, not even allowing us to even make a celebratory toast, until we placed our order, I would have ran like hell to the nearest Red Lobster!!!   When the appetizers and soup arrived stone cold, we let it go.  When I couldn't eat my entree because it tasted ""off,"" e.g. spoiled, and the waitress valiently offered to tell the chef and did not offer to make a substitution, I let that go.  When my husband gagged on his prime rib, after trying to eat it because he was hungry, even thought it arrived looking like it had just come out of the microwave, all grey, grainy and full of shiny fat globules, he let that go.  But, when the waitress presented us with our check and smiling stated that an 18% tip had been added, but ""feel free to give more if you'd like,"" we felt completely degraded and taken advantage of.  Of course, we did not want to mar a special occasion with a scene, so we let that go too, but would like to spare others the same disappointing experience, which  left an extremely bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended).  The highlight of the evening was leaving and the speedy valet service made for a quick get-a-way.   Small portions (see photos) + high prices = better off with a frozen entree!!!"
496,1,"My friends, a group of 9, waited for me to be seated while I get back from a bike ride (unfortunately, a century. In is case). When I got there, I asked the manager if it would be possible to help me secure my bike, as I did not foresee needing a lock when I left in the morning. 

the manager was fairly rude, and did not help accommodating a request as simple as parking a bike in their back space. 

It seems that despite the restaurant being more than half-empty, they don't seem to value customers. I will defer to other reviews on the quality of the food...."
497,1,"Awful food, awful service and expensive. Took 30 minutes to get food when we were one of only three tables. Burgers ordered medium well were served rare. Pulled pork had no flavor whatsoever. Gin was watered down. Never again."
498,1,"I recently had a shellac manicure using a Living Social Deal.

I have had shellac manicures before and been happy with the results.  Not the case at this salon.  After leaving I could see obvious edges that she missed - I was short on time so I didn't immediately return.  By that evening (4 hours later) the polish was already beginning to peal at chip.  By the end of the weekend they looked HORRIBLE.  Had this been regular nail polish I wouldn't have been so disappointed.  I am not looking forward to using my other coupon here - it was a complete waste of my time & money."
499,1,"I've come here a few times for lunch, and I'm a little embarrassed to be honest. A little background -- I'm comparing this club to the Rutgers club up in New Brunswick. The Rutgers Club (and their Chef) has consistently won awards for culinary excellence. I've gone there both as a student as a staff member, and I was consistently blown away by the quality of the food that they serve. 

When I was invited to go to Penn's University Club, I had similar expectations. Boy, was I disappointed. First, the whole dining room smells of tuna fish. Not really sure why. But that's a turnoff for me. Next, I didn't really see any fresh entrees. I guess their thing here is a hot/cold buffet, and it was just meh. I guess all the food is cooked by the Inn at Penn kitchen, and I've had much better food at meetings that were held in that same hotel. Really disappointing. Chicken was kind of lukewarm and devoid of flavor. I got a roast beef sandwich that was dry and frankly almost stale. This is a far cry from the hot, sit down meals that were served at the Rutgers club. 

I guess if you want to show off your 'membership', it's worth hitting up the buffet lunch here. Otherwise, you can get much more mileage for your $10 and change, and go someplace that will serve food that might actually have some character."
500,1,"I've never had fondue, and I have to say that my experience here leads me to think I I just don't like fondue!

We ordered 3 dishes and still was not filling. 

I don't like paying $50+ and still leaving hungry!"
