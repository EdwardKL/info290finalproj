1,4,"After a long hunt in the Central Square neighborhood for decent bagels and tofu cream cheese, FINALLY I happily gazed at the chalk menu of Clear Conscience Cafe that listed tofutti cream cheese and DAIRY-FREE fruit smoothies that don't just taste like water. Pretty regularly, I come to enjoy what some dairy-free Bostonians don't get to- a hearty bagel with spread. Nothing will compare to the options I have in NYC, but for Cambridge I am pleasantly surprised."
2,4,"The owners made it up to me soon after the bad experience.  A free ""do-over"" dinner and drinks for me and my friend whom I had taken out for her birthday dinner when we had the bad food and service.

Apparently, the owners were away that night and were appalled at hearing what happened.  They actually had a staff meeting about it afterwards.

The owners made it up to us so I have to update my rating back to fan status.  However, I won't go there again unless I know the bosses will be present."
3,5,"so i moved to la from texas in april of 2009. not gonna lie, in n out was a large reason for that. although looking back, i moved to texas from china when i was 6 and a large reason for that was because my dad told me there were squirrels in america. so i guess i'm easily sold.

that said, in-n-out is wonderful. i don't even know what's so good about it - the thin (and getting thinner) patty, the animal sauce, who knows? it's addictive. i try to sweet talk people into going with me about once a month.

oh and i LOVE that they have dr. pepper here. i gave up drinking soda in this weird attempt to be healthier, but i will get a dr. pepper here. they're made in waco, texas!"
4,5,"Want good pizza? Head to Papa Del's.

But in the meantime, pepperoni rolls and Pokey Stix: Get. In. My. Bell-ay."
5,5,"Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf is my second home in Claremont. I am there with my dog, Doolyn, every day that I am in town. 

Actually, I am a coffee addict and I have patronized all of Claremont's coffee places over the years. But I have abandoned them all in favor of Coffee Bean. Why? Light, space, welcoming, friendships. And great tasting coffee."
6,3,"Service is great. Food is average for a diner. Coffee is poor. The scrambled eggs are surprisingly bad- do they use real eggs or Sysco refrigerated liquid egg product? Next time I go, I'll be watching. Or hammered."
7,5,"This place has great options, but I usually go for the kimchi pork.  It's difficult to have somebody else at the table order this dish when you could have, and should have done the same thing yourself."
8,4,"The name of this place does not conjure up images of pho. I seriously thought it was a bistro with trendy drinks.

I was craving pho and my boyfriend had heard good things about this place so off we went. 

It's a lot cleaner than I expected for the Ave or a casual Asian restaurant. The menu is pretty extensive with bun, banh mi and rice dishes in addition to pho. I liked that they had seafood pho which was what I ended up ordering. My boyfriend had the beef combo. 

We both got larges and ended up not being able to finish them. I'm pretty sure it was just because I was sick though because it was an average large siZe and I always get that.

The seafood pho came with fish balls, shrimp and imitation crab. They put everything including cilantro and onions on the side. I like those things and would like them cooked into my broth but I thought it was a smart move in terms of appealing to the masses. My boyfriend thought the broth wasn't salty enough which probably means it was healthier so kudos for that.  There were no cream puffs. :(

The service here is pretty good. The owner seems like a nice man. It was a little expensive $8-9 but all in all, a good meal."
9,2,"Overpriced, poor selection, rude and condescending folks here.  The stuff is not even nice, how do they think they can charge these rip prices when it's so much cheaper down the street?"
10,4,I used to love this place when I was an undegrad at Cal. The salads there were amazing and the coffee was pretty good. I still remember the countless hours I spent there studying for physics and organic chem - really glad that time is behind me but definitely miss this cafe. The 2nd floor of the cafe is the perfect place to read and sip your coffee. Great for a student budget!
11,1,So I go grab a cali buritto after coming from the Staples center. A few bites and I taste no fries. I open it up and the fries are cut up. Seriously ? Straight up garbage.
12,4,"After some pizza on a warm summer afternoon I decided to poke inside Iorio's and treat myself to gelato. Gelato, to me, is simply a fancy version of ice cream (though I know that's technically not true) and so I'm not too picky when it comes to authenticity in this category...

But I know my way around a good dessert!

Since I came in near closing, some of the flavors had sold out, and the gentleman in front of me took the liberty of scooping up the last little bit of Mango I was eyeing. What now... And so I settled on what looked like a dark and tempting chocolate; it did not disappoint. 

Creamy and luscious and flavorful, my kid's size portion was just enough to satisfy that ""cold-sweet-chocolate"" craving that all of us are prone to from time to time. Also my barista (can I call him that) was kind enough to allow me to order a kids size, ""for the kid in all of us~""

Bright though the yellow walls may be, they do a great job of reflecting this place's sunny little disposition. 

Sadly, I think Iorio's is a little too hidden for its own good, and I find myself only passing it on the bus, my face pressed against the glass as I tell myself I have to treat myself to gelato again, and soon."
13,5,Loved the Spicy Chicken sandwich. Got it grilled not fried.
14,5,"Cabbie's Cab is a great cab service.  We live in Cambridge, and cabs are notoriously unreliable (ahem, Ambassador, ahem).  Actually getting one to show up can be a challenge, and even though Boston cabs now have to accept credit cards, Cambridge cabs have yet to adopt the customer-centric model.   Cabbie's is totally different.  He's just started up his business and is incredibly accommodating.  To start, he will accept credit cards even though he technically doesn't have to, AND he's offering great airport rates for any repeat customers or people that refer new customers to him.  Basically, the more you use him or direct business to him, he'll drop your airport rates.
This guy just ""gets it.""  He's working to get new customers and his business practices reflect that.  You'll never get into an argument with him if you only have a $20 and he all of a sudden doesn't have change.  The service is incredibly reliable, payment methods couldn't be easier, and he's a great guy, to boot (he sent us his lamb vindaloo recipe after learning we like to cook Indian food at home).  If you're planning on taking a cab, call this guy and help him grow a good business!"
15,3,"Food surprisingly good 5, interior 2, service 3.5,"
16,4,"There was a time when I once frequented the Sunshine Store on campus for coffee. This was when I thought coffee was the foulest drink to have ever slid down my throat. How bitter the taste was. How disgustingly vile. But I had no choice. I needed caffeine in my system. It was a necessary evil. As I swallowed down those accursed cups of coffee from Sunshine Store, I had to swallow my pride too.

But then one day, I discovered The Art of Espresso and they showed me that black coffee can be found at cheap affordable prices AND be delicious! Not only delicious but beyond that! Their coffees are exquisite and divine! Indeed, they have turned brewing coffee into a beautiful form of art!

And their Vietnamese coffees are delicious as well. But I think the highlight has got to be those magical macaroons they have sitting in that jar near the cashier. I shan't rest 'til I steal the recipe for myself because those things are like little morsels of heaven!"
17,5,"I've been going here since I was a little kid and this is the best custard I've ever eaten anywhere. The price is a little more than it was in the 1950's, but it's still the same great product. 

In my opinion the best flavors are the plain vanilla and the chocolate, available in a cone or a dish. While they are making new flavors - always good to try something new - you can never go wrong with chocolate and vanilla.

If you have a little time sit under the awning and enjoy your treat, then maybe walk on over to the Columbian Park Zoo and see what you can see."
18,5,Great food and service. Will come back.
19,3,"Good food in an intimate space.  Its small size can make you feel like you're talking over the couple at the next table, though.  Small portions and bitter wait-staff give this place a three."
20,4,"Swung by for dinner with a friend on Friday night and had an awesome currywurst (bratwurst, fries, curry sauce) and Hefe-weiss. Why didn't someone else think of currywurst?! As a person who loves hot-dog/sausage products it was a wonderful combination. 

A little loud - it's more of a bar than restaurant at 10:30 PM - but we found a place to sit without too much trouble. Attentive servers, quick service, and inexpensive (total bill of 2 currywursts, 2 beers = $22). Really nice crowd of eclectic 20- and 30-somethings who all seemed to live in the neighborhood."
21,3,"I used to come to Christiaan Salon a lot, but have recently not been a customer.  

Christiaan Salon has some great hairdressers.  I've never come in with a picture or idea of what I want my hair to look like, but I always leave really happy with my hair and impressed with my hairdresser.  I've had haircuts from at least five of the hairdressers, and I'm confident that all of them are great.  

Another great perk to this salon is its location.  Benefit Street is arguably one of the most scenic streets in Providence, and the building is adorable and well-maintained.    

However, I won't be back for a few reasons.  First off, the esthetician uses soft wax.  Soft wax is fine for eyebrows, but for the bikini line, some women (including myself) prefer hard wax.  My second reason for not returning is a sentiment shared by another reviewer: the attitude of the receptionist and other employees who hang out at the front desk.  I want to come and be pampered, not judged."
22,5,Ohhh Rhino.  This was my favorite spot in high school and still is a favorite of mine.  I can always find something that I really (don't) need here and it normally is a good and fair price.
23,4,A ultimate favorite..its quick and easy to get too.. My favorites are bratwurst and linguica. This the one spot that you must go in berkeley.
24,4,"I like the ambiance at Magnolia.  Granted, sometimes it's too noisy, and it's a bit pricy.  But they make a mean (and reasonably priced) tomato bisque and the drinks are good.  Last time I ordered an ""I'm effen sexy"" lol  If you hate a drink, you can request something else.  They are getting marked down because they took out their pretty Magnolia tree after which the bar is named. You thought I wouldn't notice???! :P"
25,1,"I know I am in the minority here but why is this place so popular, and why is it still around? I love the ambiance and historical side of it (it looks like an ancient tavern, why else would the space be so cramped!) but the burgers - big, soggy, sloppy, not-so-tasty monsters (and don't hope to wash your hands, and face, after eating one - I don't think they have restrooms!) Onion rings - skinny, limp and doughy is not really my style. They have an enormous list of burgers, fun names (but is there any connection between the burger and the person it's named after?), and long descriptions but  that means it only takes you that much longer to find a burger that you anyway will not like.

Take the subway down to Central and go to Four Burgers instead. 

Bartley fans, my apologies."
26,4,"Really good bagels (no wisecracks from New Yorkers, please), generous portions, great prices and super friendly owners.  This is a go-to for satisfying and affordable bagel sandwich and other things bagely.  Enjoy."
27,1,"After visiting Delucas down the strip from Pamelas, I wanted to try this restaurant to see how the ""rival"" compared to Delucas.  I had a positive bias that it was going to be good, but the sad reality afterwards left me with the worst breakfast I had ever had in my entire 28 years of age on this Earth.  The wait wasn't long, I didn't mind waiting, the atmosphere was fun with the brick walls and rustic setting from the 1950's that was all fun.  I ordered a bacon and swiss omelet and a coffee and was very disappointed, I should have just gone to McDonalds for breakfast and saved $5, at least they can make a decent cup of coffee.  The coffee I was served was luke warm and taste burned, however diluting several packets of sugar and a splash of cream in it made it somewhat drinkable.  The breakfast itself just didn't cut it, the toast was fine but how do you really mess up toast?  The hash-browns were lukewarm and weren't even hash-browns, they were some sort of slurry mixture between potato salad and marshmellow salad.  The omelet was literally pathetic, that too was lukewarm, the bacon was wilty like lettuce and not even fully cooked, it tasted like I was chewing on a bandaid, not to mention their hot sauce was completely watered down too.  The service was pretty average but nothing special (just like the restaurant).  All in all I found little no value dining at this restaurant and won't give them any more of my money in the future.  It's a shame because I had such a high hopes but left disappointed."
28,4,"Great place to grab Americano on the go...

It's cheap (just over 2 bucks), fast (it was ready as soon as I paid), and rich (not bitter in the least).

Unfortunately they're dwarfed by construction that's completely hidden the shop entrance. I have a vested interest in the following advice: make sure you stop in since they probably get far less business now that condos on the rise completely block the way in. I really need this shop for a quick fix before reaching UW campus..."
29,4,"First place I think of when I think Pizza!  Great thick, chewy crust and a wide range of toppings.  We always split a small salad with extra black olives and creamy Italian dressing.  Small selection of local beers and some nice wines. Friendly, quick service and lots of support for area activities."
30,5,"Yes. Great place. We had cheese souffle and Duck confit. Before dinner Mint Julep (wonderful). Ambience, service and food all outstanding. Glad we went."
31,5,"This is a really cool restaurant with an eclectic menu. They also can give you quick service if you need to see a movie. 

Whenever someone visits me from out of town, I take them here because I know there will be something on the menu they will like. The brunch is also great. 

I would come to the Blue Room much more often if they lowered their prices just a bit!"
32,5,"I've tried a bunch of tailors in the vicinity, and this guy is far and away the best. That said, he has a personality, for better, and for worse. If he thinks what you're doing is a bad idea, he won't help you. He may be subtle or not-so-subtle about it.

I think you have to know a little bit about what's going on. He doesn't seem interested in helping amorphously shaped people, I think because he feels like he can't help them; he can't make their clothing look good on them. Or if your clothing is poorly designed or cheap? He could probably make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, but maybe it's not worth his effort?

A little perspective on why he behaves this way. A lot of the suits on racks in there are suits he's made/making. He gets thousands of dollars for each one of those. You can imagine he's gotta be into your $25 alteration, or what's the point? Life's too short for altering mediocre clothing."
33,5,"Ate here yesterday for the first time.  Definitely a fan of the vibe - we sat up on the roof patio and it was like a garden oasis in the middle of the Baum/Center eyesore.  The decor managed to almost completely block out the view of Ritters and the UPMC parking lot next door - a major plus.  The inside was, as others have already commented, very pastel and outdated, reminding me of my grandmother's 80th birthday party.  Definitely could use an overhaul in my opinion, but then again there were quite a few old ladies there, so maybe they just know their crowd.  

I'll cut to the chase: the food was GREAT.  For not super expensive, there were large quantities, many options, a very helpful waitress who helped us make some very difficult choices, and a clear willingness to tailor anything on the menu to suit our needs.  

One last thing about the service, which is what earns Cafe Sam its 5th star -- we were running late to see a play after dinner, which was our own poor planning.  But as soon as we alerted the waitress to the situation, she bent over backwards to get us our food as quickly as possible, take-out containers so we could finish on the road, and the check paid without delay.  It was definitely above and beyond the call of duty, and we wouldn't have made it on time without her help.

Great food, great service, weird but nice decor.  I'll definitely be back."
34,5,"My go to spot on the Ave. Open late, eats on the cheap and the falafel is great. The gyros are also very good, and they serve them with a tumeric-y sauce instead of the standard tzatziki, which a nice variation and quite tasty. 

But, this is not why you go. The BEST thing on the menu is the baba ganoush, without question. Every time I go I get this. Its smokey, smooth and not bitter in the slightest, like some eggplant can get. Usually one pita isn't enough to soak up all the goodness, so I take the rest home and have a pleasant lunch time treat. 

Besides the eats, the guys behind the counter are all friendly easy to strike up a conversation with at the counter. 

And oh yea, BACKLAVA. Nuff said."
35,5,"My mom and I went to Rasa Spa for hot stone massages.  While I haven't had many massages to compare it to, my mom has and she says that it was the best one she has ever had!  She just wishes that we didn't live in Maryland so she could go more often.

I highly recommend going early and taking full advantage of everything they have to offer.  We went to the sauna before the Tranquility Room.  Then after our massages we returned to the Tranquility Room for a good two hours of relaxing.  They even brought us lunch!"
36,1,This location is dirty and the food simply sucks.  The booths had stains and dried up residue on them.  The window blinds were super dusty like they haven't been cleaned in ages.  Low quality food and it lacks good service.  This deters me from ever going to another Applebee's.
37,5,"I'm going to give this bookstore 5 stars because of their huge collection of dusty old books on philosophy, metaphysics, yoga, new age spirituality, Eastern mysticism and religions (Buddhism - Zen, Tibetan, Chinese; Hinduism, Taoism), Gnosticism, shamanism, alternative medicine and healing, etc. Lots of Alan Watts and Ken Wilber and really old theosophy books; couldn't find any Huston Smith though... Dunno why. Will return again & check with the owner.  

And I will never buy brand new cookbooks again. Jeremiah Tower, Alice Waters, The Joy of Cooking vintage version... they are all here, a quarter of its original price. Used, but that's the charm isn't it? 

They have it all - ranging from anthropology to political science to Manga to children's illustrative books... Like all used book stores, the selection is a bit disordered, so you will have to find your way around and spend some time browsing. It is messy by Border's standard, but as far as I'm concerned, everything is marked and fairly well-organized. I'm not complaining... I've found some gems here.

Yes it is dimly-lit, dusty, crowded, filled with musty smell, and there are stacks and stacks of old used books in just every corner you turn. Yes pages might be yellowed with time, and crinkled like old skin... But these, to me, are precisely their appeal and charm. I'm definitely coming back to this labyrinth again to soak in the aroma of dusty vintage books, to explore around the wooden shelves, and to see if I can dig out any more treasures here."
38,3,"This new-ish restaurant opened in the same location that longtime Princeton mainstay The Rusty Scupper used to occupy. I went there a few times in it's 30+ years of business, and found it to be perfectly acceptable American fare. JL Ivy has renovated the location, an improvement in my opinion, and created a nice menu, albeit somewhat confusing. The reason is that in the middle of steak, lamb, chicken, and lots of seafood dishes done with nice international influences, there's The Tiger (sushi) Bar. The bar is in the middle of the restaurant, across from the nice bar area. It just seemed out of place, but it does offer the opportunity to have sushi as an appetizer. We tried two of the dishes which were fine but not great. A more delicate use of sauces, and better prepared fish would have helped. The cocktails were very good, wine list was well laid out and had good variety, much in the more affordable area, and the staff was incredibly nice and attentive. Our dinners were quite good and proportioned on the large side, a nice thing to see given prices in the mid to high $20's and $30's. The creme brulee dessert we split was good but far from the best I've had (in Monk's Grill, Whistler Village, BC).

Total atmosphere is very nice, with well placed outdoor seating, though it was in the 80's that night - way too hot for me to eat outside. It's not a fantastic location, being removed from Nassau Street and all, but anyone who remembers the Scupper will find a nice alternative here."
39,5,"Cherie is the best! She does awesome cuts, her prices are comparable, and she is always up on the latest techniques and styles."
40,3,I have yet to figure out why people are addicted to these type of fro-yo places. This place is alright. I got the original with strawberries which was good. Couldn't really taste a difference compared to the competitors. Well I might try it again when i'm hungrier. I went after dinner so maybe I wasn't really feeling it. I came with my cuz who said the original tasted like Yakult. I think everyone's original taste like Yakult. Doesn't really make it original then does it.
41,5,"Phenomenal. Monica is the best. 
I want Monica to be my photographer for LIFE!!!!!  Seriously, she is the go-to person you are looking for. 

I went in for a boudoir shoot, and it was one of the most fun experiences I've had. She put me to work! Hahaha. What I mean by that is that she has had 16+ years of experience as a photographer, and as such, Monica knows what angles, positions, shots produce the best pictures. She made me lift my leg, tense my arms, crane my neck, etc. to the point where I was ""glowing"" (aka sweating)(modeling is hard work!) but in the pictures, I look graceful, toned, and sexy!

I live in San Francisco, and we had looked into shooting at a hotel nearby, but weren't able to book a spot. So Monica literally went the extra mile to pick me up from the Millbrae bart station and drove me back from her studio after we were done with the shoot. 

Monica is very easy to talk to, and at the end of the shoot, I really felt like she was a friend. She's open, kind, and caring --- she definitely did not treat me like a number/business opportunity. Monica told me that for wedding shoots, she has dinner with the couple first. If the couple and Monica decide they are a mutual fit, only then does Monica go ahead with the shoot. If the couple are obviously unhappy, or there's something off or there's a lot of negative energy, Monica will not do the shoot. HERE IS A WOMAN WHO CARES ABOUT ART NOT SIMPLY MONEY, WHO CARES ABOUT PRODUCING LASTING MEMORIES, DISCOVERING HONESTY, AND CAPTURING REAL MOMENTS THRU PHOTOGRAPHY. 
Bottom line: Call Monica."
42,2,"The best way to describe Ikes is like a yuppified version of that greasy corner sandwich shop you used to know and love. On the plus side, sandwiches are very flavorful and drenched with delicious unhealthy sauces. They also offer a wide variety of veggie ""meats"" which, as a vegetarian, is great. Unfortunately, the service makes actually going to Ike's a major chore. A few of my top complaints are listed below:

1) High price. A full sandwich costs on the order of $10 or more with no drink or chips

2) Skimps on the (fake) meat. Fake meat is dirt cheap, and at $10 for a sandwich and no table service, I'd like the meat to be falling out the sides. Instead, there's often barely enough to taste.

3) No menus in store. Since all the sandwiches have random names, you really have to pick out what you want to order online or on your iPhone before you go.

4) Online menu prices and promotions don't always match up with in-store price. So if you decide what to order on your iphone when standing in line for Ikes, you can't always be sure what you're going to pay.

5) Nickel and diming on sauces. It's $1 to add BBQ sauce to a sandwich, and even more to add pesto, on top of the $10+ you're already paying for the sandwich.

6) Long waits, both in line and waiting for your sandwich. The line always moves very slowly, and a lot of the time only one of the cash registers is open. Also, the cashiers always take a very long time, even if the line's winding out the door. After you order, it always takes tens of minutes to get your sandwich. (On a very busy day, it once took 2 hours to get my sandwich after an hour wait in line)."
43,5,"The Food?
AMAZING? The yellow split pea thing was soooooooooo good. The owner, Ben was very friendly and explained the dishes and how to eat Ethiopian food traditionally.

I absolutely love Ethiopian food and this was the closest thing to the real deal, no wait, it probably IS the real deal!!!! Since the Owner helps Eritrea and Ethiopian refugees by hiring them as cooks to cook AUTHENTIC cuisine from their countries. 

The beef tip thing (excuse me for my ignorance) was tender and well seasoned. The injera was tangy and soft. I got so greedy though I had to use a fork. 

Everything is well thought in this restaurant they even provide wet naps. (Who says wet naps are just for chicken wings)

Lets talk about the bad or lets say the not so great.

Space! Very limited. Tight squeezes. But this could be good if you bring your date here it can be an intimate experience. However since this type of food is meant for sharing with a large group of people the issue of space can be tricky.

All in all I  this place and didnt even deduct stars because of space--THE FOOD IS JUST THAT AMAZING"
44,2,"Being from Los Angeles and having tons of restaurants and eateries at my fingertips my expectations are too high at times. This place was ok, coffee was good, service was very good, my omelet was good but huge I believe it was like 4 eggs and packed with bacon and a few veggies, hollandais sauce was white??? I don't believe it to be hollandais sauce I really don't know what the heck it was, (had to scrape it off of my omelet) was pretty gross, the home potatoes were mediocre at best they were just not crispy, more like steamed, would have much preferred hash browns but I don't think we had the option. The buscuits and gravy, buscuits were huge as were all the portions, but they were not that tasty. I honestly would rather have normal size portions and get tastier food. Only went there because of the ratings on yelp in route to San Francisco. Would I stop here again next time? Probably not, who knows, maybe I needed to try something else?  Go in there expecting giant plates of food to fill up your starving belly at a decent price and thats it! Don't expect anything more than that and maybe you will enjoy it more than I did."
45,5,"This is the first place I ate in when I first came to UW and is one of the few restaurants I've continued to go to in the last few years. It's cheap, tastes great, and is open late. The best part is that It's a full meal with meat, veggies, and a pita. Definitely not the same type of pita as the Pita Pit (errr). However, the worst part about it is that they charge you $.50 for using your credit card, so pay cash. Also, I usually take out, but it wouldn't be too bad to dine in."
46,5,Finally! A cart that passes the savings down from not having a real sit-down and indoorsy locale. And SO good! I love this place.
47,5,"HUGE FRESH SANDWICHES!!

This place makes their bread fresh all day and their sandwiches are so big and full of yummy goodness!! Their BLT is amazing and they will make pretty much any sandwich you could ever want! And if you want to cut down on carbs they make huge salads too with all of the freshest veggies all for very cheap college prices. For a healthy option that will have you coming back for more go here!! There can be a really long line at times, so don't go during rush hours for eating and you'll be fine. Either way their bread is worth the wait!"
48,3,"Even though I like this place, and think their food is good it isn't out of this world.  Yes they have some good beer selections and interesting burger, salad, sandwich concoctions but I have a few bones to pick...

*This statement is on the hippy side so...just bear with me-  I was going to try their Shrimp Po Boy but noticed that they use black tiger shrimp which is on the ""AVOID"" list on the Seafood Guide. There's plenty of other kinds of shrimp they can use that aren't unhealthy for the environment OR us.  

*When I got my food it was warm/luke warm.  Other people have said that this is one of their main problems with Eureka as well.   

Things I like-

*Grass fed beef.  I'm not a huge beef eater because a lot of people haven't gotten on the grass fed bandwagon, so its nice when a place does the right thing and offers not only grass fed but veggie/turkey alternatives.  

*Beers

*Interior - it's not over the top and simple.  

*The staff is nice, attentive and helpful with any questions.  

One thing that everyone has to keep in mind is that it can get rather crowded here, especially on the weekends.  So be prepared to wait (Although the wait times aren't that long)."
49,4,"I love this place! It has a way better selection than Downtown's. I also love it during semi-annual sale time too. The store's pretty small though. I don't' recommend buying their water bottles, they can easily break. But some people are a little slow there, still the staff are nice to me. I think that they need a bigger PINK selection."
50,4,Pretty good for a small burger joint - owners are pretty nice guys... they let me try their soup before ordering it... but this place seriously needs A/C in summer... I dont want to see sweat dropping onto my burger patty when you flip it!!!
51,3,The smell of fresh brewed coffee just draws you in. I love coffeeshops and outdoor seating is a must for me. Coffee exchange delivers! Its a nice little coffee shop in Fox Point with a big deck for outdoor seating. Good selection of baked goods and free wifi. They also grind and sell beans there for you to buy and take home.
52,4,"Hello, funky Anime store in a most unexpected place! What a nice surprise on a rainy day when all I wanted was a Vivanno from Starbucks and randomly decided to go upstairs to see what stores were there. I wish I had found this store during my Death Note phase- I may have purchased a statue or an action figure!

Located in Harvard Square, Tokyo Kid is pretty unique. Any fan of Anime, or even Japanese pop culture, should check it out. They have tons of action figures (some may call them toys!), statues, regular movie dvds, Animes (of course) and other cute items like fan magazines. The prices looked good to me, and the selection was tremendous. Above and beyond what you'll find in even the best comic book stores with an anime section like Harrison's Comics.

I am definitely going to make a point to return to Tokyo Kid. Depending on what I'm watching, I might even buy something. Not one of the body pillows, that's just too creepy (unless they stock L!) but I could see myself purchasing a silly fan magazine. If you love anime, you have to check this store out!"
53,1,"I had the worst experience with one of the owners at Sidewalk Market today.  I arrived for the SLO Chamber breakfast at 7:30am and parked in front of the store in the green zone.  I checked the sign- metered parking started at 9am.  The breakfast ends at 9am.  

I arrived at my car at 9:04am and found a parking ticket from SLO Pd.  The ticket said that the owner complained that I park my car there frequently for hours on end...I have never parked there in my life.  I went into the store to appeal to the owner and let him know that the claim was false.  He smirked and shrugged his shoulders - very rude and cocky.  

I called the parking enforcement and the officer who wrote the ticket-- and they agreed to dismiss it based on the 9am timeframe and false claim.  Just a bad way to do business in the community and a bad attitude."
54,3,"If you're looking for a chill place to eat while you're at Stanford Shopping Center that isn't going to break your wallet, fill you up, and allow you to enjoy a decent sit down meal then Max's is a good bet.  
The portions are big and the wait staff is very friendly.  I'm not such a big fan of the karaoke music cd they were playing, but it was a nice departure from the norm.  

Having several TV's around to watch sports is a big plus, although they could be a little bigger ( I know I'm being anal here).

The food is good.  the complimentary bread was very warm and hearty.  

I ordered a chicken sandwich, which was average to good, but it was missing something.  maybe some more condiments or maybe the chicken was a little dry. 

overall it was a okay place in the middle of high class palo alto."
55,4,"Wow! 

The Recovery Sports Grill opened very recently inside the new Hilton Garden Inn on Hoosick Street, a sister sports bar to the Recovery Room in Albany. When I think of a recovery room, I recall waking up from anesthesia laying down on a hospital bed after a major operation and having no memory of what just happened. I spent 4 hours in the ""real recovery room"" less than a month ago in lots of pain. My recovery has been very speedy and my buddy and I decided to check out the Recovery Sports Grill to celebrate success!

This ultimate sports bar is pretty impressive for the area, which is spacious with lots of HDTVs throughout the bar. The bar is decorated with college and professional sports memorabilia from the past and the future with local fanfare support including RPI Hockey jerseys. There's a pool table and video games near the NASCAR painted wall. The young attractive servers wear referee shirts who are eager to assist you.

My buddy and I stopped here recently in the mid weekday afternoon. The place had a mixed crowd of young and older folks. We sat up at the bar and we started out with a Coors Light and a Heineken. There was a radio tuner speaker at our seats, which we could hear the audio from different TVs including the Yankees game, a similar concept to Smokey Bones and Damon's Grill. This is also the place to be for NFL Sunday to watch your favorite team.

The menu offers typical pub fare and appetizers. The prices are fair. Beer specials are offered including $2.50 pints and $10 pitchers for a different beer Mon-Thurs. $10 pitchers are offered during all NFL games.

Okay, we ordered some food to share including 10 Garlic Asiago Wings ($7.99) which were very good. The Southern Chicken Sandwich Sliders ($8.99) served with sweet potato fries were decent but did not have any mayo. The Hand Pulled Pork Sliders ($8.99) served with sweet potato fries and cole slaw and a side cup of BBQ sauce were pretty tasty. The service was adequate with several staff stopping by and asking us if we needed anything else.

Overall, the food we had was typical bar fare going well with our beers. Both of us enjoyed the food and atmosphere. This is definitely a great place to hang out and cheer on the NY teams or your favorite team. Sweet Caroline, hehe!"
56,5,"Was there for work, but the staff couldn't have been more pleasant!
They helped me try a bunch of different flavors and I went with my choice of Bananas foster.  The other flavors were fantastic too. Try the Concrete made with Hydrox cookies!"
57,5,"This small and modest place is hidden on Mentor Ave. right off Colorado. It's near the Icehouse and there's plenty of parking on the street and the adjacent structure. 

Good selection of guitars to buy but even better a lot of supplies and service. Need extras like strings or picks or anything else. This is a great place to go. And it's quite quiet in there and there always seems to be someone playing there. Don't know if they have lessons there."
58,5,"For a ""dive bar""  the brand new menu rocks.  Nothing like the Kip's menu of yore- they definitely took it up several notches. Best burger I had in a long time- and I'm used to more expensive places. Awesome spinach salad with figs and blue cheese at lunch. Friends loved the  pulled pork sliders and chicken & waffles. Way better than area competition."
59,4,"Just stopped by this cute shop yesterday with a friend. There are endless choices here and the girl at the counter was extremely helpful in helping us make a choice.

We ended up getting one of the special pie cinnamon buns, blackberry. It was big enough for the two of us to split and be satisfied. Can't believe that it was vegan! The dough was delectable. 

Totally would recommend people to go try it out. And they do offer discounts to Cal students, which is definitely a plus, since their prices are a bit steep."
60,1,"See cliff notes on the bottom.

I went with a couple of friends on a Saturday night.  Parking was easy and free at the nearby garage.  At 8PM, the place was really busy.  The live band was pleasing to listen to while we were waiting to be seated.  However, since the restaurant was full, we were seated in the patio 
area.  

As soon as we were seated, everything went downhill.  The waitress and the bar were really slow.  We waited 15 minutes before our drink orders were taken.  30 minutes passed until the drinks arrived and our food orders were taken.  Another 20 minutes passed until our fondue equipment was brought out.  Finally, a half an hour until our food came out.  

The menu is pretty much all fondue, like the Melting Pot.  Don't come here with a stomach prepped for All-you-can-eat lobster at Khoury's.  The servings are relatively small and since you do the cooking, it takes a couple of minutes before your food is ready to eat.  I came with a stomach that was ready to eat, but not starving.  However, by the time we received our food, my stomach was munching on my large intestines.  The quality of food was good, but there wasn't much flavor.  

The Hip Kitty is located in Old-Town-Pasadenish part of Claremont.  The restaurant had nice wooden floors, cathedral type ceiling, and elevated booths.  We were seated in the patio, so we just passed through the restaurant. Patios aren't usually lit, and it wasn't different at Hip Kitty.  However, if you're going to serve food that you have to cook yourself, then you should have some lighting to check if your food is ready to eat.  The patio also did not have music playing from the live band.  It would be nice to hear one of the reasons you would consider going to the Hip Kitty, the live music.

I am completely aware that we were there at the peak hours, but usually a restaurant with a menu in the ""Moderate"" to potentially ""Spendy"" price range would staff their restaurant accordingly to meet the demands of their customers.  

cliff notes:
pros: nice mature crowd, live music, full bar, free parking
cons: slow service, bland food, poorly lit patio (dining area)
recommendation: Eat elsewhere, then come here to drink and hang out at the bar for live music."
61,4,"There was a time in my life where I thought that diet soda didn't taste like real soda.  After years of drinking diet, I now think that regular tastes weird.  Same goes for fat free salad dressing, skim milk and a few other things.  Entering month #4 of being a veggetarian, maybe I'm starting to turn on tofu and fake meat.

I just had my second lunch at Veggie Heaven, and I left pleased once again.  I tried one of their specials with ""fake chicken"" and I have to say that it kinda tasted like my former feathered friend.  The prices are low, the quality is good and a parking lot on the drag is a nice change from the norm.

Asian food is typically pretty easy to do veggetarian, but I appreciate having a large menu of options as opposed to picking from just a handful of items.  

I don't plan to stay veggie forever, but I would be happy to have lunch here anytime."
62,5,Dr Barnes and his staff are very friendly and welcoming. This is my new doctor and I tell everyone to go to them.
63,4,"Dear Mayfield Cafe,

Thank you for a lovely lunch! 

As a single diner, I expect an attempt to seat me at the bar, and when I insist on a table, be offered something tucked away near the serving station or bathroom. You did neither. I was shown to a lovely, large table by the window, and the rest of the service was equally fabulous. The servers were charming, took my order promptly, and refilled my iced tea before I had to ask. Service was so attentive, that when the check arrived and the server apologized for the problem with my original server, I had no idea what she was talking about. Apparently, he had a family emergency and had to leave while the others took care of my table. I just assumed it was a ""everyone covers every table"" kind of place. 

However, I was disappointed to see the menu on the website was not current and the actual menu was a bit limited. I loved the warm, crusty sourdough, although I found it a bit odd that it was just set on the table without basket or plate. My ABLT, had wonderful ingredients, with thick bacon, more of the wonderful whole-wheat sourdough, butter lettuce and a lovely yellow tomato, but the bacon wasn't crisp, the avocado a bit skimpy, and the bread not thick enough to absorb the tomato juices. I had to pull a long strip of uncrisped bacon fat out of my sandwich and the bottom bread on the second half fell apart into mush before i could eat it. But the flavors were wonderful, especially the remoulade.

I look forward to returning."
64,4,"the people that own johnstons's are awesome.  They're super nice and friendly, and they put up with a lot of shit from the students around.  Yes the prices are high, but they're supposed to be cause it's a convenience store, and  unlike Berkeley Mkt you never feel like they're trying to cheat you.  Another great thing about johnston's is that if you ask them to carry something they'll often try to add it to their inventory."
65,3,"Three stars for yellow curry.  
Two stars for pad thai. 

 If your seriously hungry, it works out nicely.  If you can hold off, try some place else.  If you're dying for Thai, give it a shot."
66,3,"Just another Mexican restaurant in Chapel Hill -- yet a welcome departure from the chains on Franklin, and a step (or 3) above Cosmic Cantina. And I guess it's popular enough that they've just opened a second location. But you know, still a pretty typical menu -- not too different from what you'll find at Monterrey's. And yes, if you're having a birthday, they will stick a sombrero on your head, sing to you, and photo-document the experience. A good choice particularly, if you're looking for your burrito with a side of outdoor seating -- they have a raised porch that will accommodate you nicely."
67,3,"A new restaurant on Lower Sproul! Maybe this will fire up the ASUC-owned restaurants. They also have a coalition with Munch On Me, which I'm guessing to be a newly launched deal website, and I was able to get a free thai ice tea voucher to use, which is what brought me here!

When I got there, it was about 1:50, and posted all over the counter was the fact that they're not accepting coupon until after 2:00pm. Since I wanted the thai ice tea, I was going to wait. 

I was a bit hungry, and decided to get their two-entree plate, with terriyaki chicken, and also broccoli and beef with fried rice. In retrospect, it's kind of weird that a Saigon (Vietnam) place would offer terriyaki and thai tea... 

For a total of $5, the price can't be beat. (It was only $6ish and they have 20% for students, which I really appreciate. I don't know how long that's going to last, though). The food is kind of greasy, and the broccoli felt way undercooked. It's a bit disappointing, actually. All in all, I felt that the rice plate at 99 Ranch is way better than this. Also, this is not self-serve, so your portions are determined by how generous your waitress is feeling (although it was pretty generous, actually). I didn't get to try the sandwiches that everyone talk about, so I guess I'll try that next time I stop by. With so many options, though, I wonder if I'll stop by Lower Sproul again without an incentive, for food.

The thai ice tea, on the other hand, is actually quite amazing! It's decent compared to some thai places around Berkeley. Definitely recommend for a quick drink."
68,5,"One of the best ways to enjoy Ann Arbor and get a great sense of the community.

Top of the Park events are admission free  (so if you don't care for something, just wait a bit and check something else out - hard to beat with the price of admission).
 = 90% of the festival itself.

Artists, film trailers and menus are all posted on line making it easier to plan how best to enjoy the 125+ events presented in just under 4 weeks."
69,5,I love the scallion pancakes and thoroughly miss their green mango yogurt slushie (esp since I haven't been able to find it anywhere else). so good!
70,5,"hands down poshh has the best jeans selection in ann arbor. i stop in here a lot, mostly because chatting it up with wendy, the owner, is one of my favorite pastimes. staff is very helpful without being too pushy (one of my least favorite traits of boutique shopping). during art fair their tent sale was mana from heaven (wendy took a real L on a lot of the discounts, but they allowed me to buy way more than i need). they're recently started doing these $25 sundays which seems to be a fantastic idea because the line is out the door. one note: this selection favors the flatchested and devoid of body fat set mostly, though the jeans do run up to like a 32. none of their cutest dress are going to fit a woman with anything over a small B cup, but alas, this is women's clothing these days."
71,5,"so, i just got my hair cut and i'm beyond ecstatic with the results. 

first off the place is luckily a block from my work so i don't have to deal with parking woes. the place is clean/modern with super pleasant front desk people. you get a robe, you get some beverages, you spend a lot of time in the cutting chair. 

the shampoo you get is pretty much top notch. they use their own products in store (duh), and it smells heavenly and makes your hair so unbelievably soft. plus the girl who shampoos your hair will give your head a massage that's much needed if you work in an office like i do and frequently get migraines.

i made an appointment with betty and she's a lifesaver. my hair hasn't seen a pair of scissors in 8 months minus a botched bang trim i got this month that forced me to find a new stylist. for $60 bucks you can leave a new person and i am loving the cut! for this kind of service/cut i would usually end up paying more (and have in the past) i brought in a few photos and left with it pretty much as close as i can wish it to be. plus she styled it for me. i usually hate having stuff put in my hair but this stuff (wax/body spray) are very light so i don't mind as much.

of course i had to purchase some products. they even sell a shampoo for us sinners who wash their hair everyday aptly named ""everyday"". 

i'm happy to say that i finally found a new stylist."
72,4,I love the pizza here. So friggin delicious!
73,4,"I went into Craigie on Main prepared to love it. Not only was it my goodbye-for-now dinner with Josephine L, it was one of her favorite restaurants. And considering the height of her standards combined with her breadth of food-savvy, I was predestined to click with Craigie as instantaneously as I clicked with her.  As it turns out, my attempt to love Craigie bore a much closer resemblance to my attempt to love swimming. I tried all the strokes, and I tried the 6-course chef's whims with the same enthusiasm, but I left not completely impressed and feeling like I wanted to swim with fins.

Some highlights from my chef's whims:
The Tuna Sashimi was amazingly fresh, and the toasted garlic topper made it absolutely exceptional.
The Potato and Green Onion Vichyssoise with oxtail pastrami is as green as sea glass, and the light, crisp green onion evenly balances the rich, heavy potato perfectly. I love skillfully-made soups, and this one is no exception.
The venison sausage, suckling pig confit, and grilled pork belly with cherry coulis was amazing. The sausage was a bit too rich and salty, but the gamey flavor of venison is always welcome on any plate of mine. Grilled pork belly is guaranteed to be fantastic as long as it's not cooked grievously poorly, but this one was perfectly seared. The fatty sweet-meats of the confit and belly fit my definition of umami to a tee.

My one huge issue was that the they had the nerve to charge the Strawberry Sorbet palate cleanser, a one-inch ball of sorbet, as a full course. When we complained, the manager handled it quickly and politely, thus the only deductions earned were applied to our check and not to my star rating of Craigie. The service here is the stuff of legends.

Dessert did end our tasting on a high note as my Coconut Sorbet with pumpernickel, bing cherries, and chocolate crumbs was simultaneously rich and refreshing and Josephine's Apricot Frangipane Torte was yet another tasty conclusion.

Sadly, all good things must come to an end, and I tearfully bid Craigie a premature, untimely goodbye, much like the one I bid Josephine at the conclusion of our meal. I will see Josephine again and I hope it will be soon, but I'm not sure I'll see Craigie again, even in the remote future."
74,4,I think this is the best Italian in the New River that I have tried and I love that you can bring any wine from their wine shop directly to your table for only a $2 fee.
75,2,"went there last night 12/18 to celebrate our friends engagement . Requested songs, they didn't know so 15 bucks blew. then made a $20 request for a Capt n Tenille song ""love will keep us together"" to have th couple go on stage.

76,1,"I used this dental office for 10 years and have been generally satisfied with their care (Dr. Rodrigues is a fine dentist and we love the hygeneist Nakoma) but the last two years the business office has become too difficult to deal with. 

First - Dental One started two years ago to add a deep periodontal cleaning to the twice a year cleaning, this is so they could charge an extra $39 a pop.  Then, whenever the Dentist would suggest a treatment like ""you should get that crown replaced someday, but its no  problem now"" we get phone calls in the evening from the business office asking us to schedule an appointment.  When we'd explain that we were not ready to schedule it, they'd argue with us.

Even though we pay the estimated bill (minus insurance payments) a the time of service, lately they have taken to calling us the instant the insurance company comes back with a different amount and demanding payment over the phone.  When asked to send us a bill they would say the bill is due now and that interest will added to the bill if we don't get them credit card.  

The last straw was when my spouse recently forgot to take a credit card and they demanded payment before she could leave the building.  Before their new business manager took over that wouldn't have been a problem and they'd simply have sent us a bill.  After all I've been going there for 10 years (and referred ther patients), but not anymore.  They treat you like a shoplifter.  To add insult to injury, they charged us twice for my wfe's recent cleaning.  I think I'll just pay the extra $34 as a stupid tax and move on.

The evening phone calls and way-too aggressive business office practices are just too much.  There are too many other dental offices (with much better reviews) than Dental-One.  I'll miss Dr. A-Rod, but we will be moving on."
77,1,"You know you rule the land and like any other evil dictator, you charge your citizens an exorbitant price for goods and don't improve conditions all while the sad, sad people wander around in a desperate attempt to gather sustenance in a cruel maze that can break even the most emotionally stable among us.  (DAMN IT, where are the taco kits NOW?!)

What you did with making the aisles too narrow for two carts: psychological warfare.

And where do you find your employees?  All of your cashiers hate life and want me to hate life, too.  Since they are working for a place that obviously doesn't give a crap about anything, can you blame them?

You know that people aren't going to walk the 2 minutes West down the same street to the whatever-it-calls-itself-now supermart because people don't want to end up held up and robbed, but people seem to forget that there was a shooting at the movie theater across the street from this joint.

So continue to do what you do, Fresh Grocer, since no one's going to shop anywhere else if they live anywhere near University City.

Pros: open 24 hrs, free parking with min. purchase, cheap pizza slices, cheap day old slices of cakes/cheesecakes near the bread (before produce), Redbox

Con: Secret circle of hell.  Satan is probably a little happier each time you step foot in the store."
78,3,"After months of walking through C-cubed to get to the co-op, I think I finally realized why people come here.  Three reasons:  1. Dairy-free smoothies  2. Strange soylent green-colored liquid shots and 3. Iggy's bread.

The dairy free smoothie made with strawberries, bananas, and mint was okay but lacked in mintiness.  It was, however, the perfect post-Prana yoga pick-me-up ever.

The strange soylent green-colored liquid shot was in fact made from wheatgrass, which you know isn't actually soylent green, because you watch them pull a mat of grass out of the fridge and onto the counter.  Then, blades of the sweet grass are plucked from the dirt and blended to liquid form.  The shot at $2.25 is very small, but since they put so much effort into making the shot and warn that the flavor can be a personal preference, small is good.  But I actually liked it.  I'd do it again.  What does it do for you?  No clue.

Iggy's bread.  The best around.  Bagels, bread... head to Central Bottle Wine + Provisions for more of the good stuff.

So why the fair rating?  I just can't get over the juxtaposition of the cool organic sustainable feature-filled cafe dotted with dirty seat covers often occupied by Central Square ""local flavor.""  I'm happy to order a drink or a snack, but once that transaction's complete, get me the hell out of there!!"
79,4,"Green Street has relatively simple, but delicious food. I don't know what it is, but they definitely have the whole ""making a few things right"" thing down. A friend and I went for dinner last night and split a salad and pasta and they were both delicious. It's a little pricey for me to have too often, but it's a nice treat every once in a while."
80,5,"Started going here about a month ago for Invisaline. I was referred by a coworker. Dr. Eshom and the girls are everything my buddy said they would be. They are all very professional and really make you feel comfortable. As far as my Invisiline, its great.

81,3,"Not only is Cupkates the latest in a trend of interestingly flavored cupcakes, it is also a mobile eatery.

So far I've tried the Salted Caramel, Red Velvet, Double Vanilla, and Key Lime.  The Salted Caramel was really good, I love the combination of sweet and salty.  I also loved the Double Vanilla because I love anything with Vanilla Beans.  The Key Lime was different--they actually have a graham cracker bottom and some key lime jelly.  I loved it as well.  Red Velvet didn't go over so well with me (still think Marita's Sweet Potato Pie Co. is better).  The cakes are moist and their frosting is not too heavy.

In general I think their cupcakes are good, but I've been to Sprinkles and various other cupcake boutiques on the east and west coast.  I think they're good, but I've had some pretty mind-blowing cupcakes elsewhere.

They take credit cards, and that's always a plus!"
82,2,"for anyone who has eaten an actual frankie, they know this is NOT a frankie. They need to stop calling it that and getting peoples hopes up. 

As a roll, its pretty good but does not compare to bade's or calcutta roadside rolls."
83,5,"Silvio makes the best pizza that I have ever had.  I cannot emphasize this enough.  He has ruined pizza in America for me.  I can't even recall a pizza in Italy that tops his, though if you look enough you might be able to find something on par.  If you like a deep dish or a NY style cheesy pizza then this might not be the place for you, but then you and I are probably creatures that are destined to never understand each other.

His toppings are fresh.  The cheese and sauce is flavorful and used where appropriate.  The combinations are creative.  And, most of all, the crust is so delicious you eat it all by itself with a huge smile on your face; it's chewy, not too thin, and never doughy.  My two favorites are the Truffle and the Arugula pizzas, but there are many others that must be tried.

Other elements are also great: the soups, salads, and most especially the pastries can be super delicious (check out the Bombas, with real custard filling, and the Sfogliatella).  In addition to all this, Silvio is just a very kind fellow who shows a great commitment to local and organic food.  He makes me sad that I recently had to move away from Ann Arbor, but maybe the ultimate sign of how much I love his food is that before my wife and I moved we had him cater part of our wedding."

The chicken shawerma is the shiznit... the rice has these lil pieces of noodles in it.. put that in ur pipe and smoke it competitors... its mad busy during lunch-time, but they're very efficient at getting customers in n out... doesn't take as long as it seems."
85,4,"This is from a customer's point of view:

All the sales girls were really nice.  The stuff is pretty cheaply made, but it's also trendy, so buying a cute trendy top for around $20 is cool with me, I find it the same quality as F21.  I thought the regular priced stuff was a bit expensive for the quality, but I went in last Friday, 12/10/10 and they were having an extra 40% off of sale items.  I got two cute tops for around $11 and a really cute cocktail dress for $22.  Even if I wear these things three times each, I'm getting my money's worth.

I first discovered Cafe Intermezzo while working in West Berkeley. My friend and co-worker, a Cal grad, loved the place and suggested we get salads for lunch.

Yes, they are huge. But I'm for quality over quantity and I just don't think the balance is here.

90,4,"Can't go wrong with cookies and ice cream. This is also something that could easily be made at home, for much less than $2, but manages to attract a huge line of college students craving sugar every night. I haven't bought a sandwich since they raised their prices from $1.50, but jumped at a free coupon deal online. I'm limited flavor-wise since I don't eat dairy because it seems they only have one soy flavor at a time: the first time, I had soy mint chip with turtle cookies, and recently I had soy cherry chocolate chip with chocolate chip cookies. The cookies are nice and gooey in the center, but somewhat hard on the edges. The cherry chocolate chip ice cream was surprisingly tasty--I liked that it had real chunks of fruit in it. I gobbled my treat down in record time because it was yummy but also because the sandwiches get messy fast! The workers are always cheerful, and oddly there's really loud music in the store. Line wraps around but it's only a ~10-min wait."
91,2,"Honestly the food here isn't great -- it took me 4 trips to find something tasty but I did enjoy the fried green tomato flatbread.

I had the beef and tofu soup. The beef was fatty and disgusting; it obviously wasn't cut for quality. The majority of the soup was tofu, which would have been fine if it had absorbed even a little bit of the soup's flavor. Even then, the flavor left something to be desired - way too salty.

This is obviously a stay in and eat sort of place. I found myself wishing I had a manual or perhaps some kind of instructional video. What do you do with all the little containers of food? Do you dump them all in the soup? Eat them separately? 

I did a little bit of both, and that part was delicious. I couldn't tell you what I was eating, but the three containers: rice, something orange, and tofu with some green stuff - all tasted excellent. I almost wish I could have just ordered those three sides rather than having to suffer through the soup.

Although I recommend eating in, don't bring a large group. There is very limited seating. The food also takes a very, very long time to be prepared. It could be that I'm spoiled by the quickness of other restaurants on the Ave...but if you do decide to partake, bring a book, laptop, or DS to keep yourself occupied.

I ran into trouble when I went to pay as well - they don't accept credit cards for purchases less than 15$. I think that is a rather steep minimum to set, but the lady was nice and let me pay with my card anyway.

Overall, not a great experience. I really wanted to like this place, as I'm always down for some well prepared tofu. The Korean Tofu House does not make the cut."
94,5,"In reply to Tom G's review : 
I believe freedom of speech is one thing but tarnishing someone's reputation is another thing.
I witnessed what happened that night .  Maybe if you would have written what REALLY happened it would have been clear why the bartender was rude to you.
You and your friend stormed into the lounge without asking the bartenders if you could use the bathroom.  I'm sure they would have let you, but you guys didn't bother to ask, and when one of the bartenders informed you that the bathrooms were for customers only YOU gave an attitude and said, 'I WON'T BUY ANYTHING IN THIS BAR.""  Your friend added passionately, 'YOU GUYS SUCK.'   A couple of customers and the manager also witnessed this.  I'm writing this because i believe and want to tell you  that 'HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY.'  And everyone appreciates courtesy as well.
FYI  there are great new bars and restaurants on 8th avenue, and L lounge happens to be ONE."
95,2,"Ugh! I'd rather have a dirty car.  That about sums up my experience at this car wash. 

I was on my way home and decided to get my 'natural camouflage' removed from my car. I drove in and felt like I was trapped! There are 3 lines that go into this place.  You drive up and pay at a self service touch screen.  I have NO idea how you actually get the wash you paid for, because all three lines then become one line in no orderly way.  Maybe I got the $10 wash that I didn't pay for, or maybe all the washes are the same and it's a scam?  I don't know. At Bubbles they write a number in soap on your windshield, but here you have no idea how they identify your car.

When you finally enter the car wash, they get the cars so incredibly close together, I thought there might be an accident inside the car wash.  I have never ever felt anxiety going through a car wash until this place. At one point the mechanism that drags your car forward made this horrible noise below my tire and I thought we would crash into the car that was only feet from ours.  When we got out of the wash I still had soap on my mirrors and water all over my car even though it had already been 'blow dried'.  I couldn't find an open vacuum station so we just left.  

With so many options for a car wash including directly across the street from this place, why go here?  It's the same price at Bubbles express wash for a more pleasant experience and I've always been able to find a vacuum to use.

Keep on moving and pass this place by in search of better cheap car wash options."
96,4,"Their open-faced egg salad sandwich is to-die-for. It's SO GOOD.  It really is as good as everybody says it is. It is very messy and hard to eat, though, so you'll probably drop some of it everywhere. Make sure to have a fork to pick up the stuff you dropped onto your plate!

I've only tried that, sadly, so I can't comment on the rest of their food. Unhelpful I know...

Cons are that their prices are a little high for their portions, and they are very small and crowded, so finding a table is a real pain."
97,4,"Super cute and cozy restaurant with a lot of tasty healthy options. There are only a few tables with no ac on a hot day, feels like you're in your own kitchen. 

They pride themselves on organic ingredients and each dish is designed with calorie count and vitamins in mind. 

The menu consists of: 
Deli: small dishes with options like ratatouille, tofu salad, couscous & grilled vegetable salad + more
Main Plate: tofu hamburger steak, salmon, vegetable rolls with beef, chicken + more 
Rice Bowls/Noodles: options with veggie, fish or chicken
There is also an extensive list of teas, served cold or hot. 

I went with the veggie rice bowl, added the boiled spinach with sesame deli side and a strawberry lemonade. The dishes also came with miso soup which was not made with all sodium, it had carrot, potato, shitake mushroom, spinach and tofu. 

Everything was homemade, delicious and amazing. The portions are generous, we all chowed down and finished our food and felt very satisfied."
98,4,History and SC Football. All you need to know.
99,4,"My first experience with the 23rd Street Cafe was half of a breakfast burrito someone didn't finish on the drive home from LA to HB. I hate to say it, but the thing was even better than Nick's in Seal Beach. It was incredible.

My second but first real experience was in-house, and I was SO impressed. The place is on a corner and if you weren't looking for it, you probably wouldn't notice it. It's like a sparse cafeteria, and the diversity of the menu is unexpected. From American to Mexican to Indian foods, it runs quite a gamut.

I had the pupusa and samosas, which took a little while to get but were worth the wait. The pupusa was a pupusa, but the samosas were so good with the mint/cilantro sauce I almost ordered more but stopped myself. I still don't know why."
100,5,You will dream about these donuts. They are that good. Just go there now.
101,5,"Mmm...Dog Haus hits the spot.  I visited their restaurant four days ago and I am still thinking about how delicious my meal was.  We ordered our dogs with a side of tater tots and they were perfectly crisp. The hot dogs are quite large compared to slaw dogs.  I'm a fan of both restaurants, but I have to say, sorry boys size does matter."
102,4,"At first I wanted to give this place 3 stars, but little details had enough leverage to buy an extra star.

GOOD:  Curly's is awesome in many ways for being a little chicken shack on Howell Mill Road.  First of all, this place is JUST a shack -- but a really nice, new, clean-looking shack.  The menu is short and simple and the combos are an outstanding value.  All of the chicken is high-quality, natural meat that you rarely (if ever!) find at this price point (combo meals $7-$9).  Fried chicken, shrimp and white fish, mac 'n cheese, fried okra, etc.  I got a meal with 3 tenders, one side (mac 'n cheese), a tiny bit of decent, vinegar-based coleslaw, a drink and a piece of white sandwich bread.  The slaw and bread were disappointing, but the chicken and mac 'n cheese were delicious and filling.  The tea was SUPER sweet, ahem, for my skinny white ass.  

BAD:  My meal took 30 minutes to make.  THIRTY MINUTES!  Fast food!  I understand that my chicken was made to order, and I know that takes a hot second.  But damn, 30 minutes was way too long.  Yes, the chicken was perfectly crunchy and flavorful and fresh and moist and delicious.  Yes, the mac 'n cheese was gooey and hot with chunks of molten white and yellow cheeses.  But waiting on that tiny, unshaded patio with the sun melting your face is no fun, and I actually watched several people walk away after waiting for 20 minutes or so....

FOR THE WIN:  The staff behind the counter are AWESOME.  The pretty young lady that took my order was fun and happy and helpful, and the gentleman helping in the kitchen was joyful and entertaining and equally helpful.  And, Curly was frying my chicken!  The staff here were honest from the start about a long wait to get fresh, cooked-to-order chicken that was sure to please, and they sincerely wanted me to enjoy my lunch.  

I'll be back, but only if I manage to call my order in 20 minutes ahead of time.  I'm not a very patient man."
103,5,"We had a great family dining experience here earlier this week - I really love the rennovated old building feel, and the way they weave history into the ambience but still manage to be modern. It's the kind of place that could be romantic enough for a date but casual enough to bring the whole extended family. The food is pub-fare but with some good twists (lobster mac and cheese!). I had the BLT (with avocado and goat cheese). Very delicious. There were also veggie burger options that looked good. Wait staff was friendly and accomodating. Definitely recommend this place!"
104,3,"One dollar sign for the price range? If a $10 pot of tea or a $5 brownie gets one dollar sign, then...sure.

This place is really overpriced. And though they advertise free unlimited wifi, there aren't very many good spots for getting work done - unless you like working on floor cushions or on backless squatter stools.

The tea WAS incredible, and the staff was extremely friendly. A fine environment for having a cup of tea with a friend. Not for getting work done."
105,5,"A definite must when in Boston.

A recent trip back east had me using my trusty Yelp app and I wasn't let down.  The consensus was a mixed bag.  When reviews are all over the place it makes me want to try a place even more just so I can find out what the real scoop is.  

Here's my spin:

You can't beat a three-course lunch for $10.  If this exists anywhere else please be kind and let me know because I'd really love to start eating like this daily.  All our food was perfectly plated, well seasoned and tasted fresh.  We were ecstatic to find out that we weren't limited to how many main courses we were allowed to order.  At that we took advantage and ordered as much food as we could stomach!

Technique's service was exceptional.  Our reservation was honored and although we were early we were seated right away.  These kind folks put up with us taking pictures and asking questions.  Basic tourist stuff.  They all wanted to give us suggestions on restaurants to try and places to see before our trip back home.

All in all a positive experience and I would love to come back!"
106,4,"I love this place! Number one Korean restaurant in Berkeley (in my opinion)! The servers are suuuper nice and the food is decent enough considering they're catering to college students. When my friends want to eat Korean food for the first time, I always take them here. :))))))"
107,5,"Yogurt Park makes me happyHappy! They are one of the reasons why I come out to Berkeley. Not only do you get the best bang for your buck (the boyfriend and I split a large, which is $3), but the frozen yogurt is actually creamy rather than icy as some places can be. You're allowed as many flavors they offer in one cup, and they pile on heaps of toppings! But beware of gummy bears! The coldness will make them hard, thus causing difficult chewing. I LOVE their tart flavors that really taste like yogurt, especially the natural flavor and the red raspberry (when combined, HEAVEN)!"
108,5,"A Princeton favorite! I worked here on summer during college in the early '80s, and thankfully not much has changed since then. The wings are superb -- tangy, spicy and served with a rich and creamy blue cheese sauce. The salads are fresh and healthy. And Chuck is a great guy. So glad he's still at the helm after all these years. I hold every other buffalo wing to the standard of Chuck's, and rarely do any come close to the taste of these!"
109,5,"I have been going to Fantasy Nails over 15 years. I love this place, but I must say the technicians lack consistency so it is all about who you go to here.  Kathy (the owner), Angela, and Lynn are all really good.  I am a fan of Tracy.  She is fast (mani/pedi and eyebrows in about an hour) but for the price ($20 for a mani/pedi), I really can't complain.  I do wish they had a better selection of polishes.  Still a great place!"
110,2,"I moved to this area a year ago & Papa John's has been my go-to pizza relief because it is fast, friendly and cheap. They always have good promotions (usually at least 25% off, sometimes 50% when you order online). The delivery drivers that show up have always been more than friendly and always gave me coupons for next time.... until recently. 
A few weeks ago I tried to order a pizza with white sauce online, but didn't see the option for it. I called the store & the young man explained that the white sauce was reserved only for the spinach alfredo pizza. Even if I waned to pay exra for it, I couldn't have it unless I got that particular pizza- ugh. Dinner plans changed.
Today, I ordered a small hawaiian pizza at around 2PM or so. I figured it was after lunch, well enough before dinner... shouldn't take too long to get here (I'm literally right accross the street!). Over an hour later the delivery guy shows up banging on the (plexiglass?) of my front door instead of the wooden frame ... maybe he didn't notice that I have a doorbell... I mean it is right underneath my apartment number and all... oh, well, I forgive him because 
MY PIZZA IS HERE!
I opened the door to find a frazzled middle-aged man handing me a wad of receipts asking me to fill in his tip and sign- no joke-
HE DIDN'T EVEN SAY HELLO :(
I usually give tips in cash & I almost considered not giving a tip this time, but I figure he might have been having a bad day... or new and hasn't had proper training on how to smile at your customers yet  :-/         I gave him a buck anyways because my pizza was still warm.

Sorry, Papa Johns... If I have to get dressed on my day off just to walk over there and pick up my pizza in order to avoid the angry delivery driver, then I might as well go to Regent's Pizzaria and treat myself to a stuffed slice. If I am ever desprate for delivery again- Dominos delivers just as quick + I get delivery for free from Shoprunner + they have white sauce & will put it on ANY pizza you order, not just the spinach alfredo."
111,5,"I like what this store stands for: hand-made and fair trade. 

It was started by a church group, to help craftspeople in developing countries find a market for their products. It's the opposite of Walmart.

Besides the fact that most of the money goes to the makers of what you buy (employees are actually volunteers), it's astounding to see that there are lots of well-made, handcrafted decorative and useful objects. It makes mass production look kind of silly."
112,4,"Now that my puppy love stage with The Fresh Market is over I feel that it's fair to review it.

We'll start with what sent me in to my blissful denial stage. 

When you walk in, the smell of fresh flowers and the classical music immediately put you in a great mood.
It's a fantastic way to start off a shopping trip. (not so good for my wallet) 
Everything is beautifully laid out and merchandised wonderfully. 

You sometimes you forget you're in Latham.

(Although the zen like shopping trip are null and void when you go on a Saturday)  

The merchandise-  

The orange juice is super delicious but pretty pricey.   They used to have a sample area for it but that has since disappeared.

I heart the coffee and all of the coffee choices. My favorite is the chocolate cherry.   It's actually cheaper than the Green Mountain that I usually buy. 
I also love that I can get a little sample of coffee to have while shopping.

Spices!  I love the little spice bags I can pick up for 1-3 bucks on average.   I can fill up my spice collection without breaking the bank.

Notable mentions-The ginormous olive bar, the fact that they carry hearts of palm (although none from Brazil)  and the set price for the you pick 6 beers.
The sun dried tomato and asaigo cheese bread.

Excuse me for a second.
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh mmmmmmmmmm

Okay, I'm back. 

Now onto the reality stage of the relationship.

Besides the already mentioned poor cheese selection, the bread selection is probably worse.

Since they don't seem to carry the Ezekiel bread I usually buy, I was going to treat myself to regular old wheat bread but after scouring the small bread section I couldn't find anything that wasn't filled with gross ingredients.  
Also, I don't think they carry almond milk.

Now for the embarrassing part.   
In a moment of starved weakness I purchased a spicy trio sushi platter.  It was pretty gross all around but what do you expect?  However, it gets worse.  As I was stuffing a piece in my mouth I looked over and and staring back at me was a piece of shrimp that was not de-turded.  (I'm no seafood expert but I have seen Tommy Boy a number of times.)
Let me say, I didn't finish my mouthful.  

That was hard for me to admit but I felt it was necessary to save someone else from making my mistake. 

I still love The Fresh Market as a fun little excursion and a place to get coffee but not as my regular shopping place."
113,4,"Really good food. Surprised that they didn't have sushi there, but highly recommended."
114,5,More of a tip rather but they now sell their salad dressings for $5.95 a jar.  My favorite is the Asian Sesame.  Take out is prompt and delicious.  Would love delivery though!
115,5,"In today's world of cheap, replaceable drugstore pens, writing with a fountain pen truly is a lost art. However, nothing can convey personality, elegance, and sophistication like a signature, note, or letter written with a fountain pen. With that being said, for those wishing to foray into the world of fountain pens, I believe Flax Pen to Paper is one of the best (if not the best) places in Los Angeles to shop for a fountain pen. Owners Joan Flax and Phil Clark know their pens extremely well, and their store's wide variety of selection and stock make it really easy for the customer to select a solid fountain pen. 

I recently visited the store to purchase a Lamy Studio Fountain Pen with a fine 14K gold nib. I had already researched the pen I wanted, and from a previous Lamy, I already knew that I wanted the fine nib, as that particular nib thickness suits my writing style well. I had made up my mind, and I was ready to purchase. Once in the store, Phil had me dip and write with the pen I thought I wanted. I thought I had done my research. However, what I didn't know was that a pen with a fine 14K gold nib writes more like a medium stainless steel nib. It was way too thick for me. Long story short, after dipping and trying out Lamy pens with extra fine, fine, and medium nibs, in both stainless steel and 14K gold (Flax has that kind of variety in their stock!), I decided on a Lamy Studio Fountain Pen with a fine stainless steel nib. Even the extra fine 14K gold nib was way too thick for me. At the end, several open Lamy boxes were left on the table, showing how many pens of different thickness nibs they offered me to try. They got me a fresh unopened pen to take home with me, and even offered to clean it for me. (Lamy fountain pens come with a very small amount of ink from testing at the factory, so it is recommended to clean the pen before filling it with your favorite ink). 

Fountain pens are very personal. With different kinds of nib thicknesses available, in both 14K and stainless steel, it is extremely important to test drive a pen to decide if it fits your writing style. (Hint: certain nib thicknesses are more suitable for some writing tasks over other nib thicknesses - inquire within). Flax is as good as it gets when it comes to pens. 

Other miscellaneous notes:
* Expect to pay full price here over online retailers. However, try testing out and finding the **perfect** fountain pen online! Nope, can't do it. 
* The store is beautiful - a pleasure to walk through and browse. Merchandise is presented very attractively, and organized and laid out very well.
* When you walk in, they ask if you need help once, but then they leave you alone to browse. They are not pushy or clingy. However, when the time comes that you need help or have questions, they are extremely helpful and attentive. 
* They sell Rhodia pads, paper, and journals here. Rhodia makes (in my opinion) some of the best paper to write on. Rhodia paper is better for fountain pens than Moleskine paper. 
* They also carry other writing accessories besides pens and paper: pen cases, greeting cards, agendas, artistic presentation supplies, fountain pen ink, fine desk accessories, etc. 
* Parking on the street is easy on weekends. However, during the week, all bets are off: circle around the block multiple times and pray to get lucky and find a street spot, or park in one of the adjacent lots for a fee. 
* This is a niche store. People who are picky, picky about their pens and paper come here. This is not Staples or Office Depot! 
* A good starter fountain pen is the Lamy Safari - reasonably priced, takes cartridges and converters, and the nibs are interchangeable.

117,4,"Oh em gee. $6 for a ""small"" sub (which is more like a super large, since it could easily feed two hungry men, or one hungry lady like myself for two meals)... you can't beat that! I've had the chicken / eggplant parm each time, and it's never let me down. No frills, no fuss... just really good sandwiches at very reasonable prices. Yum.

Just awful."

I came here for my second anniversary during lunch hour. The place is cozy and the service is excellent. That being said, I would imagine that it can get really loud when it gets busy.

We had the Calamari for an appetizer which was served with a garlic lemon sauce. Great calamari, and I've had my fair share at other places. A salmon bisque came with my meal and also bread (which looked, smelled, AND tasted amazing I ordered the Stucca ravioli and my lady had the shrimp capallini. They must of gave her 10 huge shrimp with her order--it looked so good. My food tasted like ravioli had a baby with pumpkin pie and then bathed in awesome sauce--it really was something else.

One of my favorite Italian places that I have ever been to. Puts Olive Garden to shame."
120,2,"During my years at Columbia, Tom's was a staple for cheap diner food...but that doesn't mean it was any good. Burgers, grilled cheese, steak, turkey dinner...Everything is thoroughly mediocre at best, and the waitstaff ranges from indifferent to mean.

You know what though? Their shakes are pretty good."
121,4,"I'm addicted to this place.  Granted, some dishes are hit or miss (I think the quality of their chicken leaves something to be desired) but I love, love, love their beef hard shell tacos and my husband loves their carne asada quesadilla.  Their fries are always good too with just the right amount of salt.

The guys that work here are friendly and willing to accommodate.  

It's not a fancy place by any means but it's good L.A. fast food that will satisfy the tummy."

Miso soup is pathetic...no TOFU :("
125,4,"The menu is a simple chalkboard of various cuban sandwiches (turkey and veggie options available) with an assortment of chips as a possible side ""dish.""  While my pressed classic cuban sandwich was super greasy on the outside (the wrapper was soaked!), the toasted bread and hearty ingredients were very good and savory. For $5, you get a ton of ham and pork. I prefer to balance my meat and cheese with some veggies, so the classic cuban trumps the traditional cuban in my opinion. The lightly salted plaintain chips and my sangria soda were a very nice balance to my sandwich.

Only gripe is that I felt wasteful upon leaving. I used more napkins than I would have liked in order to soak up the oils on the outside of the bread and they unfortunately do not recycle the glass drink bottles. Mother Earth cried a little today after I left. :*("

The banana chocolate fritter was alright, but the peanut butter one will never be forgotten!

130,5,"It's kind of far from the general Harvard Square vicinity but this place is exactly like Pink Berry except it had daily different flavors from raspberry to oreo to apple. However, to me, they all taste the same as the original with a bit of the flavor's after-taste. The toppings are great ranging from fruity pebbles to fresh fruit to graham crackers, etc. I wish they had mochi though... 

for all the newbies, this frozen yogurt isn't like the traditional vanilla/chocolate frozen yogurt we're used to. it literally tastes like frozen. yogurt. like the danon/yoplait kind. tangy,sour-ish. a small serving is about 100 calories and you can top it with fresh fruit or other eccentric ice-cream toppings like graham crackers and oreo bits. 

compared to yo-berry, this place is sooo much cheaper. yo-berry is insane as a frozen yogurt can cost up to 7 dollars easily. ridiculous. anyway, it's a small joint and can get crowded easily. there are about 10 seats in the place...so it's not great on bad weather days as you most likely have to go outside or take it to go."
131,4,"Dominck's is all porch and patio, with two counters inside where you can order jars of sangria and beer in mason jars ranging from little single-glups (okay, probably 12oz) to the mighty half-gallon.  

The sangria suffers from the common misconception that bad wine can produce decent sangria, and from the further misconception that bad sangria is like bad pizza or bad sex: it's never so bad that it's worse than none at all.  

I'm not so joyless I won't admit to the pleasure of lounging on the massive two-story front porch or in the back yard between the fountain and gazeebo with dozens of breeder spawn underfoot.  But the bad pizza and bad sex allusion was unintentionally prescient: Dominck's offers both.  You can order the bad pizza, or mediocre sandwiches at the longer of the two counters inside and I truly do not want to imagine the post-sangria activities of the predominantly law school and greek house crowds that gather under Dominck's massive eaves.  

The intercom system that announces food orders turns into the loudest, most annoying bouncer imaginable at 9:30pm (last call--it fancies itself a ""restaurant"" instead of a bar, but how many restaurants declare a ""last call,"" and with bullhorns, no less).  Promptly at 10pm, air raid sirens blare, a cruel audio equivalent of the ""ugly lights,"" and the staff gently but firmly begin to herd people outside.   I'm sure their neighbors love them.

Somehow, despite all this, I'm relatively sure that whoever you are, you will *love* Dominicks.  You will seek reasons to go there.  You will recruit teams of people to  meet you there at 5pm on Fridays to maximize your sangria-drinking time.  You will buy the half-gallon jar of sangria before you even know how many people will show up to share it with you.  And you'll be too sangria-delighted come 10pm to be remotely fussed by the apocalypse-heralding ""we're closed"" foghorn.  

So just give in already and love it.  

Not open on Sundays."

We ordered an app (which I can't even remember what it was, possibly a salad?) and then an entree only to find the food (I had steak medallions) brought out practically charcoal they were so over-cooked.  One person in our group got the salmon that looked/ tasted only slightly better and I don't recall the 3 meal.  Sounds pretty memorable, huh?

To be completely honest, these are all things that I could foresee forgetting about and give them another chance, but when I'm paying about $25 for an entree, the last thing I feel appropriate is for a waiter telling me that the dish was supposed to be cooked that way and that I clearly didn't know what medium-rare meant...

To write too much more would be a waste of my time and yours.  Don't bother with Madeleine's.  Cafe Verde is right down the street and has very similar price-points.  Biggest difference is the food is fantastic there..."

137,5,"Nom Nom Nom Nom ... 

This place is delightful!  As a hardcore Thai fan I frequently shun Chinese food.  Mostly because I feel the bland ameri-chinese is greasy and unsatisfying.  This place however blew me away with their authentic Sichuan food!  Who knew Chinese food was this good!  Damn those restaurants that try to placate the American palate!  The millions of dried red chillies that were scattered through a pan of flaming fish, calling to me with their flavorful, spicy, and tender meat that had layers and layers of flavor.  This place is just around the corner from us, so we'll definitely be keeping it as a go to.  Tip - You'll have to ask for the Sichuan menu, they won't automatically give it to you.  Also the servers will give you plenty of tips on what is good, and what are the most popular dishes that people order."
138,5,"Under New Management. The new Manager, Jacob is AWESOME. Provides GREAT customer service. Imagine that; Great- no, GREAT customer service for my hard earned cash!!!"
139,4,"Thai Dish is my favorite Thai place in close proximity to my workplace. Definitely go there when the Sox aren't in town or else it's packed with fans who order ""Pad Thai"" because ""that's what you get at a Thai restaurant right?"". The food is great and they are super welcoming to vegans and they make just about anything vegan friendly. They also fill your water glass promptly."
140,5,"How anyone could give this place anything but a million stars is beside me. I have a boyfriend who never gets full-I swear his stomach is a bottomless pit of doom. It costs a fortune to feed him...until now!! I told him that I would take him to a special dinner at Veggie Heaven and I would buy and everything. We got two full entrees, bubble teas, edamame, an egg rolls. We left there with his belly and my wallet full. The entire meal was $20.50!!! Where else can you go and get AMAZING FOOD and not spend more than $30?! Veggie effin heaven that's where!! The food is amazing vegetarian food that isn't bland, the restraunt is cozy and a bit cramped but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make for the quality and price of the food. Mushroom tangerine and Texas tofu. Get it. You won't be sorry you did."

Yeah, making a friend eat a piece of bread with no water would be better than here. I understand it just opened. Yes, construction was halted cause the economy sucked. But to pay $8 for some regular-ass ramen to go and get like maybe 10oz? Even the ID district location is better, even though the one time I ate there, I got sick. It ain't spectacular, and I might as well have chewed on a damn sham-wow."
142,4,"I love ice cream, but ice cream doesn't love me. It's a love hate relationship. However, the control freak that I am, I feel the need to conquer and win sometimes. I bought a bunch of Lactaid pills and drove off to battle.

I always add  yellow cake, almonds, and vanilla bean ice cream. This time I added cookies and cream. Sometimes, I'm in the mood for chocolate syrup or heath crunch bars. Whatever I decide to mix with, it's always food porn.

When you put tip in the jar, they usually sing some weird corporate song, but they don't at this location. I was about to put my hand back in the tip jar and pull my 75 cents out, but figured that was too cheap and rude of me."
143,4,"This is what Westwood needs more of:  places with good quality food, that aren't overly expensive, and are actually nice to sit in.  I really like the pizza here, but also want to give a special shout-out to the salads (the Fresh Tracks [i.e. the garden salad] is fantastic) and the meatball parm sub.  While the food isn't cheap, it's definitely a step in quality above Enzo's and Lamonica's (although don't get me wrong: I like those for what they are).  Also, the place is nicely decorated, clean, and has several big TVs showing sports all the time.  I really hope this place stays in business, and helps start a trend of more quality establishments and less crap in the Village."
144,2,"Stopped by today and sampled a bunch of their yogurt. They were good but not great. Each flavor was very high in calories, leading me to believe they were more creamy. I prefer my yogurt tarty. But for those who like chocolatey or cakey flavors, this place probably has some of the best. Lots of interesting flavors. I ended up sticking to the plain tart though, which still is thicker than most of yogurt stores', but better than Red Mango's. The texture was a bit hard but they had good toppings and good syrups. Decor was okay, nothing creative, I still like the place but it's just not as good as other frozen yogurt places I've gone to."
145,4,"great crepes and my go-to breakfast place to take visitors in morningside heights!  You can go savory, egg filled, or sweet....basically a little something for everyone, you don't even have to get crepes!  I highly recommend getting the ratatouille as a filling; either with your egg filled crepe or in the option that I think comes with chicken and goat cheese.  They take a long time to make everyone's orders so I wouldn't recommend this for breakfast or brunch if you are in a hurry, but the coffee is bottomless so if you have time sit back and enjoy!  There are so many toppings/fillings everyone should be happy.  For veggie lovers out there, you will be happy to know that crepes come with a side of potatoes AND salad!"
146,3,"The coffee here is pretty good.  The pastries are excellent (they even sell mighty-o donuts!).  There are lots of outlets... so almost everyone can plug in their computers.  There is extra seating in the back (but not a lot of outlets there) and upstairs.  The place feels old, has cement walls and is pretty cramped. Also, the place faces a parking lot... so the atmosphere isn't my favorite and any of you claustrophobic people probably shouldn't frequent this place (I can barely stand this place for more than a couple of hours)... but I do enjoy getting Mighty-O donuts next to campus and decent coffee."
147,2,"Came here once with a friend to just grab a traditional lemonade, which they said was the least sweet out of all the flavors that day.  Even with all the ice melted, I had to pour out some into another cup and add water, since it was so sweet.  Good flavor, though.  Otherwise, this places is terribly expensive, and I could get away with spending this much money on a lot better food in larger portions than this place.  Sigh, what we do for convenience..."
148,1,"Very disappointing experience looking at diamonds there.
The salesperson had a snooty and uncooperative attitude.  He made fun of our questions and showed us he was only going to give us a limited tour of their offering.
He didn't want to measure my girlfriend's ring finger size saying it was store policy in order to prevent us from just buying the stone and ring online...  He really sounded bitter the whole time.
Granted, we are just getting started and know very little about the various specs available.
However, that experience guarantees we won't buy anything from this chain.
The funny thing is that we were dressed up as we were coming back from a Mother's Day event."
149,4,"I have been going here since I was a child since my mom worked at Harvard for 30 years and I had piano lessons around the corner for 10 years (and how many summers did I work there?) -- I sure miss the old coop and not sure how I feel about the neo-capitailistc book chain of Barnes and Noble handling this place BUT when I wanted a copy of ""Anna Karenina""  (which I've read three times, one of those times in the original Russian) because I could not find my copies the woman behind the counter directed me to a new ""definative"" translation by a husband/wife team (one a regular poet, the other a Russian poet) I hate to admit it -- she was right.  
I also like their selection of magazines - it is diverse alright."
150,5,"So this one time, we were going to a show at the Blind Pig. We were going to see Rasputina, and thusly the group of six all decided independent of one another that dressing up like Neo-Victorians would be a great idea. So here we all meet up and - surprise! - it's all top hats, bowlers, hoop-skirts and corsets. Sounds like the beginnings of a great night.

Where Kilwin's comes in is that we showed up super early to the show, and wanted something to do. We stumbled across Kilwin's and decided to grab some ice cream and sit along the sidewalk.

I think the fact that Kilwin's looks all ""old-tyme"" had something to do with it. We were in character, after all. 

After being a fan of Stucchi's for so long, I was really surprised with Kilwin's. All these commercial companies try to do this ""slow-churned"" ice cream stuff, and thinking back, they're all a bad version of Kilwin's normal ice cream. This stuff does not taste like it's fat free, and I don't even care! It's a thick, flavorful ice cream that really hit the spot that night. Plus with the outdoor seating we were able to catch a few strange looks at our clothes."
151,5,"Bacaro LA a great little hideout near downtown and USC. 

Food: Small tapas rule this place. Expect small portions packed with flavor. I always order bread to keep me sated after too many sips of wine.  I recommend the bruschette, paninis, and caprese salad. 

Service: The service is usually good and they remember you after a few visits. Very knowledgeable and will do their best to get you waht you need. A for effort. However, the last time I was there a couple actually walked out because they didn't get service....I didn't know what was up with that. 

WIne & Beer: They have an awesome list of imported beer. I personally recommend the Fischer. Not only are the bottles awesome to play with, but its smooth and crisp. If you want some new, exotic, and exquisitely dark try the Xangu from Brazil. So every visit warrants a new taste of a new wine. I usually ask for a recommendation, but they let you taste some wines before making a decision. HOwever, if you are lucky (sine the seem to ALWAYS run out) order a glass or beter yet a bottle of their Tintero Moscato. Absolutely sweet and delicious. My friends and I liken it to sugar in a cup. It's just a super fun drink. I've ordered too much of this wine in my lifetime. Also Monday's are half off all glasses. So it's simply a steal!

Atmosphere : Quaint. It's hip and cool and some people get stylish when they go, but totally not necessary. Above you is a wine bottle stained glass light fixture, which you don't notice at first, but realize it mid way through the night (it took me 3 visits to realize it). The huge chalkboard wall displays the wine list and maybe even a sketch or two of one of the workers. 

Overall: Great place. Very small, but I never had to wait. If you come in a group come early or try to get lucky. People are friendly and conversations come freely. Worth any drive or casual drop-by if you are in the area."
152,3,"Craving for soup, I decided to stop by the Soup Company since it's my first destination on Southside. I settled on the New England Clam Chowder 16oz, which came out to be about $7. For an extra $1.50, they will give you a bread bowl to go along with your soup. If you aren't willing to pay for that bread bowl, don't worry because all soups come with a free piece of bread! The soup is pretty good, nothing out of the ordinary, but it does have a lot of substance (potatoes, clams). 

Compared to Stuffed Inn, my destination for soup on North Side, the new england clam chowder at Soup Company is definitely much more expensive. However, the Soup Company does provide a large variety of soups so if you are looking to be adventurous, checkout the soup company!"

154,1,I didn't know it was possible for an EVERYTHING bagel to have zero flavor. And be expensive at the same time? They should be embarassed.
155,5,The high pressure bed is amazing.  I also had a coffee wrap there... best ever!
156,5,"Great fast, pleasant service. I kept hearing ""I found a better deal!"" My trip was slightly complicated, so I looked around on the web to ballpark the prices, and then decided to see what a human could come up with. I was not disappointed! I will use STA again."
157,1,"I recently took my 1 year old  to this salon for her first haircut.   I was happy to pay the price as long as it was going to be a good experience for my child.  I knew my daughter would fuss but I was hoping that the cute store and child-friendly stylists would help.  It turned out to be a horrible experience.  The store was very cute, but the stylist didn't make a single effort to make my daughter comfortable.  She just pointed to a chair and mumbled ""you can put her in that chair"". No smiling, no getting to know each other, nothing.  Then I noticed that the safety belt on the chair was broken so I pointed it out to her and she said "" oh yeah, this one's broken, you'll just have to tie it"".  Well, you can't really tie those belts well because of the kind of fabric, and you can't expect a 1 year old to sit still, either.  I did the best to tie my daughter into the chair but after about 5 seconds of wiggling around, she almost fell out of the chair.  Thank goodness I was ready to catch her.   And I should point out that all the other stations were empty so I'm not sure why we had to use the broken chair.    My daughter screamed throughout the whole time and the stylist did NOTHING to try to make her feel comfortable.  She just kept trimming with no expression whatsoever in her face.  

The concept of this store is fantastic but not if you don't hire the right people.   With a kids hair cut, the stylist's ability to communicate well with the child is just as, or even more important, than the ability to cut well.  And it only makes sense to charge those high prices if you can give your customers the whole experience.   Todays experience should have cost $10 tops.    So disappointing since the concept of this store is so great."
158,4,"The promised return was on a Tuesday evening while a DJ was also conducting a trivia contest for customers who were likely regulars since they had group names for the contest and I think were supposed to bring some kind of membership card.  I point this out only to be able to say it was loud music and loud talk by the DJ during the trivia questions.

A pint of Brooklyn Pennant Ale ($4) and another of Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA ($5) helped us weather the contest until our 10 Wings ($7.95) with garlic & parmesan arrived.  They were crispy on the outside, meaty, and moist on the inside.  You could also choose to have them breaded - we didn't.

It's been a long time since I've had Fried Mozzarella Sticks ($6.95) and especially with the option of choosing a raspberry dipping sauce.  There were at least 6 or 8 of them to the serving and because we focused most of our enjoyment on the hot wings first, once the cheese started to cool I wasn't as pleased with them.  They need to be finished while still nice and not.

These two apps and the beer pretty much satisfied our cravings and hunger.  But we had been intrigued at the notice of a Garbage Bread on the menu.  I don't recall the base price, but we had added sausage, mushrooms, peppers and onions for a total of $14.95.  I must warn you that their garbage bread is so large that it can easily serve 4 people.  There had to be almost 20 pieces of which 18 came home and provided 2 more days of meals.

I've already pointed out the large selection of beers on tap, and with two enjoyable meals under (over?) our belt, we look forward to returning and trying more of the menu.

NOTE:  An encounter I've NEVER, EVER experienced before...
Check your bill for ""Rounding.""  That's right, they will round the total of your bill to an amount that, I believe, is easier to make change from.  Ours was rounded UP 4 cents to $42.  We weren't complaining, but curious enough to inquire of our server how it worked.  What was the rounding point?  Fifty cents?  She said she didn't know the actual process, but thought it could be to the next closer nickel or dime.  She also said there have been some people who complain about any amount that is rounded up, no matter how small the amount is."
159,4,"I know nothing about the pizza but the wings are pretty damn good.  The hot buffalo sauce is unlike any other standard sauce.  It is a bright reddish orange with lots of specks of black pepper(?).  To me it doesn't taste like the normal butter and frank's red hot.  Be prepared for alot of heat because this place seems to be the only place that can pack in the heat and still have amazing flavor.  The wings themselves are not puny sized, at least the couple of times I have gotten them.  Unfortunately I have never had it right at the shop, only gotten take out and had to wait at least 20 minutes since I don't live that close.  I think they would be even better if I had them there.  I used to really enjoy The Ale house wings but the last time I was there they just didn't taste as great."
160,4,"Great, fresh, organic salads and dishes in a cozy cafe near UPenn.  Try the white dog tapas platter of the day!"
161,3,"Solid local pub. Cash-only as far as I can tell but no warning about that, which sucks. Food is boring, just OK, but traditional Irish/pub grub if you're into that sort of stuff. I am, and it was...serviceable and overpriced. 

I've only ever gone earlier in the day, or once late-late-late on a Thursday night where it was completely dead even though the rest of the bars in the area were all closing at that point. Not sure whether it has enough charm for me to ever want to brave the crowds during more popular times (the way I will, grudgingly, for brunch at the Druid or a night at River Gods.) 

Something about it just feels weirdly ominous to me, and I'm pretty sure that if I ever try to use the women's bathroom in there I might be stabbed by a murderer or transported to Narnia. I don't know where the women's bathroom is and I've been here three or four times. It appears to be off some creepy hallway. I know extremely well where the men's bathroom is; the regulars have a charming habit of leaving the door wide-open so that I get an undesired glimpse of stranger penis all the way across the room. There's also a room with a pool table(?) and a patio, neither of which I've ventured into at all because of my aforementioned terrors. 

It's fine. It's...it's just fine. Except for unsolicited stranger penis, that is rarely fine."
162,2,"I used to love the fact that they had a cheap buffet for lunch and dinner, but expanding it to a sit down for dinner seems a huge mistake. The buffet was the best part.
Best part that is until both my friend Andrew and I got very sick. We now do NOT go to this restaurant and now refer to that incident as getting ""a case of the Khana Peena"". This new term has been used for the flu, and the other instance of food poisoning that has occurred since then."
163,4,Called Lily's for a boutonniere after seeing them at Ken's Florist for $10-17. Lily's quoted me $8 for a simple one.
164,4,"It's a diner, so I'm not really expexting much. But the food is good and always hits the spot. Can get crowded at the end of the night and the patrons at these times aren't always the most behaved, but any other time is what you find at other diners.

Not a big fan of their homefries, but I almost always get an order of fries with cheese and gravy."
165,3,"I came here one night because I didn't know where else to go.  To be honest, nothing else looked good so I thought I'd give this place a shot.  I ordered the one of their stuffed potatoes, a cider, and a white chocolate chip and macademia nut pazookie.

The potato wasn't the most awesome thing on earth.  Which is sad thing, I think.  It had all the elements necessary for fantastic salty engorgement: potato + cheeeeeeeese.  I kind of shrugged the whole thing off as.... a-ok.  Not godawful but it didn't seem like I was having a revelation either.

The cider was great.  I really loved it.  It was smooth, fruity, and not too carbonated.  I'm not much of a beer person, so it was nice to have this alternative available to me.

The pazookie is where it's at.  Hot, melty, gooey goodness in a tiny deep dish plate.  Now, to those who are not in the know... it would seem like the pazookie is large enough for sharing between 2 people.  So not true.  I swear you'll be dueling to the death with your spoons and forks for the last bite.

So, I can understand the negativity when it comes to the food in general.  I would say don't come here for dinner.  This place is just right for an after-dinner drink and dessert."
166,3,"comfy seats, that made it right for me."
167,3,"Crossroads is a fun and convenient place to buy average quality clothing and accessories, if you are not too fussy about condition. It looks like hoardes of UW sorority girls bring their castoffs in here and...one chick's castoffs are my adolescent daughter's treasures. She loves it here (or used to...she's fickle) The stuff sold here reflects the taste of the buyers who are all in their 20s and look like they are used to dressing well on a budget. However, if you are looking to sell your stuff, don't expect to get top dollar--Crossroads buys low and sells low--that is what makes it fun to SHOP here! If you are a seller and feel that the price offered is too low, ask the buyer if you can consign your item. I've sold two pairs of boots on consignment at Crossroads-- for five times the price that the buyer was willing to pay when I brought them in. Crossroads keeps half when the item is sold on consignment but I was still much better off consigning. I like that they give you the option of donating to a charity at the counter rather than getting a shopping bag."
168,5,"I have never had a bad meal here.  Not only have I been happy with each successive new menu item I try, my expectations are continually shattered by this establishment's culinary expertise.

Hands down one of the best restaurants in Ithaca.  If they served lunch and dinner I would be hard pressed to suggest a better restaurant.

Bravo."
169,2,"I'm a long time (7 years!) Drexel student and live just north of campus now. After two major snow storms this week, my car's stuck in its parking spot, so I decided to try out this new Currito instead of Qdoba where I normally go for a burrito.

Like most of the new fast food places on Drexel's campus, the staff is slow, inexperienced and indifferent, and the food is lower quality than any normal outlet of the same chain. I don't think the people staffing this Currito have ever been to a Qdoba or Chipotle, the chains this place is trying to emulate, despite there being multiple locations of each within a mile radius. They'd see how you run the line at a place like this. Instead, the staff is dreadfully slow and purposefully avoids eye contact with the people in line.

I'd easily ignore all of that if the food was good, but it's not. I've never had a more tasteless burrito. It simply tastes like lemony rice and nothing else. The tiny portion of beans and toppings on the classic burrito had no flavor at all. They dare call a scoop of chopped tomatos ""salsa"".

I won't be coming back to Currito. I'd rather take a 40 minute walk to the Qdoba or Chipotle and get a burrito with some flavor."
170,5,"Super cool place in a nowhere land. I don't ever frequent midtown and would have never known about this place had I not gone to the Fox to see Wicked. We were early and looking for time to kill, Churchill Grounds is right next door and had just opened at 1pm so we came on in. For parking, you're fucked, but it's midtown, we actually parked a block away in a garage before it got chaotic. But never mind that, the place is really, really cool. Very jazzy, upscale vibe, jazz was actually playing and the bar was super laidback, like a good speakeasy before the crowd. Beer selection is very nice, liquor even better, and plenty of wine too for the grapeheads. Bartender was super friendly and soon after the manager (or maybe owner) came over to talk beer, also super polite and courteous, making us feel very at home. Prices are a little high but hell, it's midtown and you'll pay this anywhere for lesser choices and service."
171,4,"matsuri is a great place for authentic japanese food and then some. they offer the usual fare, fresh sashimi and a host of inspired japanese dishes with a twist. i've been twice and have tried at least a couple of new dishes each time in addition to my usual must haves and have not been disappointed. good place for a group with purist and fusion style taste in japanese food.

173,5,"""If you took El Vez and you made it a little better and a little more expensive, but you also made the food a little more authentico."" - HA! Josh F. nailed this review. I have little left to write, except that for University City Dining Days ($30 pre fixe that gets you 2 apps, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert per person) may be the steal of the century. 

The decor is out there - way out there - but in a fun, crazy way, that has the ""I love it there but I'll never be tempted to do this to my house"" kinda feel.  

My dining companion and I went all out on the Dining Days Menu - 

Our apps were the Gauc, which was standard, but tasty, the gazpacho was delicious, and the yellowfin civeche with a citrus chile salsa may have been the winner of my life. HOLY LORD, I would make packs with the devil and other undesirables for that civeche. And when was the last time someone got excited over civeche???

We had pulled pork tacos, which packed a punch too. The duck and cheese bake that came with the warm tortillas to wrap it in. was exactly what you'd want in a vat of duck and baked cheese - glorious. Mind-numbingly glorious. There was also a crab enchilada and divers scallops... all was happiness, all was good. I can't wait to bring the boy here, and friends."
174,3,"I prefer Quickly, over all its neighboring joints, for a decent, strong servings of pearl milk tea. Their teas are always strong, fresh and never disappoint me. Pearls, however, are a little lackluster in terms of texture; they can be a bit harder than other places like sweethearts. But I still prefer their pearls because they are not sweetened. 

I like the fact they have a wide selection of pearls, jellies, grains to add to your drinks. Personally, I prefer their lychee jellies and barley in mine. I recently became addicted to Jasmine Green Tea (w/o milk) with Barley, after a friend of mine recommended it to me. I can't go back!! It is a little unusual but I think the combination is delicious, especially the paired with the creamy barley flakes. It's also probably a lot healthier than the jellies and pearls.

Their food/snacks are not up to par with their drinks though. I find their popcorn chicken to be more like strips of chicken, chewy and thick; and the calamari popcorns are overprices. However, I have wanted to try their french toast strips for awhile...so we'll see. 

Overall, this is my go-to place for asian drinks and be adventurous with your drinks!"
175,2,"Visited for lunch with a group of co-workers (6 total). The restaurant is nice and they have outdoor seating. I ordered the duck confit salad. It was bland for my taste. My coworkers ordered the Roasted Mushroom & Black Bean Tostada and Mahogany Salmon Salad. They also thought the food was just ok and a little on the bland side. Given all the restaurant options in Palo Alto, I probably won't be going back to this place for a minute."
176,2,"The ordering process is just ridiculous.  I enjoyed the food when they were Mandarin Wok, so we tried to eat at Golden Harbour.  The menu was SO EXTENSIVE as to be completely intelligible (with little to no description of each dish) and the ordering was so completely annoying for a party of two that just wanted to order two small entree-sized portions (VERY RARE thing here) that we left without ordering.  There are a lot of options for Chinese food in this town, ones with a MUCH better dining experience.

I have however had a few take-out dishes from Golden Harbor that someone brought to a gathering and they consisted of relatively the same brown sauce with different vegetables, some with mushrooms, some with squash, some with greens.  Rather ordinary, nothing terribly special."
177,5,"We came to Pacci for Midtown Restaurant week but decided to order off the regular menu instead. Very interesting space...I'm still not quite sure how I feel about it. Very plush interior with red velvet furniture and dark wood finishes, but the fringed accessories and large glass balls seem out of place. The server uniforms look as though they just stepped out of the prohibition era. The service was great though, so I'm done trying to figure out the decor. 

We started with a caprese salad and flatbread with goat cheese and honey. Both appetizers were a good portion size and the food tasted great. For entrees I had the shrimp carbonara and my boyfriend ordered the potato gnocchi. I was far more pleased with my entree than he was. As someone who recently lived in Italy though, he's a little picky. My entree was rich but not overly filling. I ordered the half portion, and I still didn't quite finish it all. The shrimp carbonara was served in a cream sauce with house-made pancetta, sweet peas and a fried egg on top. Healthy? No. Delicious? Yes! The pasta was fresh, the shrimp were perfectly cooked... I was a very happy girl. 

We skipped dessert this time and headed up to the rooftop bar. I will definitely be back again."
178,4,"I have to say that I love Argentinian food first.  I love Lala's and my old, now defunct standby of Patagonia CAfe (RIP).  When I found out Il Capo had empanadas, I knew I had to try it.  I thought the place was Italian!  My stylist told me to go for the cheese and onion...they are fabulous.  I couldn't agree more.  I had one of those and one ground beef.  Both were so good.  Tasty, crispy, delicioso.

Can't vouch for the rest of the menu but there were several couples eating dinner and it looked good."
179,4,"The Mansion was a beautiful and perfect indoor venue for our July wedding hosting 200+ people. The ballroom had enough room for a buffet setup, DJ, cake tables and seating for all of our guest. In addition there was plenty of space for dancing! The front rooms of the mansion served as great space for a cocktail hour. We highly recommend renting the entire Mansion for larger weddings. We really liked that the Mansion allowed us to hand select our own vendors. Our only complaint is that the air conditioning had not been turned on in the front of the Mansion until right before our event. However, the ballroom was cool and comfortable. We recommend the Mansion for any event!"
180,4,"I've been there twice since it opened. The burgers are the best I've ever had. But i suggest ordering yours more done than you normally would, or else they're a little bloody. Make sure you try the burger sauce! The fries are just ok, and the onion rings are too salty, but the sweet potato fries are delish."
181,4,"Indie movie theater, with big cinaplex ammenities and comforts. Good mainstream and non-mainstream films, but with a nice feel and comfortable clean surroundings. Could use some more sloped, stadium style seating though. This should be an automatic for all movie theaters."
182,5,"I've been trying lately to find more places to shop, with the primary aim of finding something in my new town that will be to me now what Sway was when I lived in Berkeley. They have unique pieces that are wearable and affordable, lots of cute shoes, and super helpful and friendly staff. I miss the East Bay for a lot of things, and Sway might be near the top of that list."
183,5,"I love I luv video! If you live in Austin and have a love of movies then go here! I always found what I was looking for...the only probably is that weird  
formaldehyde smell coming off of the wooden racks. Other then that, it's great.
P.S. - Free Beer Tuesdays!"
184,4,"My girlfriend and I got a last minute reservation here on New Year's Day 2011. What a treat! It is a small place and the seating is tight, but there is no loss in intimacy.  The food was fantastic, pasta perfectly cooked, incredibly fresh, light and savory flavors.  Excellent wine menu.  Pefect Italian dinner!"
185,5,"I am so excited that Bondir is open!  It's around the corner from my home, and I go by a few times a day, so I've been watching and waiting... and salivating a little.  
Chef Bond's reputation is stellar, and the feeling when you walk in reflects how carefully the decisions have all been made, even though the feeling is not pretentious or fussy.  You know that if this much thought was put into the tables, and the plates, and the lighting then the food cannot have been neglected.  Sure enough, the stunningly fresh and local ingredients are treated like royalty and the few things I have tasted so far, in my two stops in to check it out, have been delicious.
Bondir is a jem, and I am so thrilled that it is my neighborhood!"
186,5,"I absolutely love this place. I have been in here a handful of times. I enjoy chatting with these guys, they are always super friendly and have interesting things to say. They are amazing at remembering names! I love going in there and them being like ""Hey Garrett, long time no see, what can I get ya."" Paul, and all the people there are awesome.

I have never had anything here that isn't top notch. The reuben dog thing is very interesting, and very tasty if your into that sort of thing like I am.  The pizza sandwich is good, and as someone else said, they are good at creating things for you too.

The sandwiches are a little bit more pricey than some other sandwich shops, but they are way more than worth it. Go here."
187,4,"I wasn't really sure what to expect before going to Raven Grill.  I hadn't heard much about it, but when some friends suggested it and made reservations, I didn't object.

We went on a Saturday night and even though I had read some reviews about parking being difficult, we didn't have  a problem.  It is, however, located in a strip mall, so maybe during other store's business hours it might be more problematic.  The inside is nice- not super fancy or snooty but perfect for a step-above-casual dining experience.  

The menu was diverse...almost too diverse.  Their offerings included pasta dishes, fish, chicken, steak, and sandwiches with cajun, Tex-Mex, and southern comfort food flavors.  The only thing that really caught my eye and stood out to me was the special of the evening: bacon wrapped scallops with mushroom and spinach orzo.  Since bacon makes everything better (especially scallops), I couldn't resist.  

The scallops were cooked perfectly and there was no shortage of bacon.  Yes, that's right, they were double wrapped in bacon, which should be every carnivore's dream come true.  The orzo was delicious and went perfectly with the scallops.  

Even though Raven Grill isn't really in my hood, I had a great meal there and I'd definitely go back again.  My friend got the grilled cheese and it looked amazing, so that might be next on my list to try!"
188,4,"First review...i feel special.

So all in all, this will hopefully become a great neighborhood joint.  Interesting cocktail menu - all of which were tequila based - with a decent selection of accompanying wines/beers.  I'm not a big tequila fan, tried one anyhow and it was ok.

Had two different ceviches to start, both of which were pretty good, and had some interesting flavors - for example, tuna and watermelon together.  Simple, flavorful, and refreshing.

If it weren't for the tacos, which were well above par, I might have delivered three stars.  However, the tacos were really damn good.  I had a chicken and a shrimp taco, and both had great flavors, were nice and hearty, and finished off the meal really well.

I'll have to reserve judgement on dessert for another time, as the only thing they had tonight was flan (it was opening night, so no hard feelings), and that's just not up my alley.  I'm certain there will be another time, so I'll comment then.

All in all, I really hope this place does well.  The food is better than Lupe, and although I really enjoyed the Beleza vibe, I hope Midtown shares the same opinion as I do about this place..."
189,3,"Great iced coffee and fast service.

I like this location much better than my usual Peets locations: Walnut Creek, Pleasant Hill, Lafayette.....

Maybe I'm just trying to channel my inner hipster...

But I may not have enough piercings to hang out at this location."
190,2,"I am soooo torn in writing this review right now!

So let's break it down into two visits, one nightlife related, one evening food related.

Nightlife:
I came here for a friend's 21st and waited for an hour until 145 a.m. (yes, 15 min. before close) when I just said f**k it and left with my friends. Honestly, what is the point of maintaining the line that close to closing when the bar itself is not at capacity??

Evening:
We came here at the end of Fall semester as an organization to celebrate a job well done. Our group of 10 was seated promptly and the waitress did an awesome job in accommodating our group. We came on a Thursday I think which meant $3 burger with AMAZINGGGGGG fries. Their fries are double fried so they have a great crispy crust. On top of that, they have a good selection of beer on tap to complement your meal. Expect to pay more for a pint than for your entire meal haha.

So it's quite bittersweet... awesome bar food place turned horrible bar at night? This is life :("
191,4,"What the heck?  Why the bad reviews?  This is THE cleanest UO I have ever been to in my life.  

I'm the kind of shopper that only buys stuff when it is on sale (unless I absolutely-lutely-lutely love it).  If you have ever been to UO when it has its additional sales off of their clearance, you know you need to go with a lot of energy and a clear mind, or you might go crazy on some beezies trying to get the same skinny jeans as you.  Their clearance section was organized by style and gender.  Jeans here, dresses there, shirts there, jackets over there.  This is a rarity, especially during the additional sales.

If I lived in SLO again, I would be frequenting this place.  Thank god I don't."
192,4,"Celebrated my Hubby and Bother's birthday during restaurant week. Great offerings for the low price. There was something for everyone. Loved how they offered steak, chicken and salmon. It was definitely a good time had by all!"
193,4,"I've heard some complaints about this place, but I seriously think that it's awesome for what it is. It's a non-profit aquarium where the main focus is on research and preservation. The staff consists of mostly volunteers and is very nice for its small size. The only thing that sucks about this place is the food. Eat first before you come here"
194,4,"The 4-stars are for the lemonade drinks. 

The blood orange is great and you can mix it with the watermelon lemonade for a nice refreshing drink. The blueberry mint lemonade is also really good. You can actually share a lemonade with someone and it'll be enough. After a while it gets a bit sweet/tangy and overwhelming so sharing is definitely recommended.

Tried the food but wasn't impressed. Basically a fancier version of Whole Foods' salad bar.

Had a slice of cake a while back (forget which flavor) but because they're pre-sliced, you kind of taste the fridge (do you know what I mean?)."
195,5,"The sausage is awesome.  All the other reviews talk about it so I won't go too in depth but it is tasty.  I don't know this for sure but I have heard that they make the sausage themselves.  The buns are unique too.

What sets this place apart is the cheerful service and great German beer.  Shultzy's is doing it better than Prost, Die Bier Stube and Feierabend.  The beer is cheaper and you don't have the same level of pretension at Shultzy's.

The patio is great and best of all they have a sweet happy hour.  Thursdays are $3.50 for .5l of German beer.  That is about half the price of the other ""German"" places.

I highly recommend this place."
196,4,"By the time we got there around 12:30 on a sunday afternoon before church, they ran out on most of their macarons (which is the reason why we went). So, we got stuck with 8 sea salt caramel macarons!

But, i'm glad we got stuck with them, because they were delicious. They're much bigger than paulette's and just as tasty (if not tastier). I wish they had more of a selection by the time we got there, but I guess we came a little late. 

We will be back to try their egg salad sandwich...and other macarons!"
197,3,"A brand new business on the Ave, Worth the Weight is, as the name suggests, a pay-by-weight Asian buffet. For $5.99/lb, you have a bunch of Japanese, Korean and Chinese dishes to choose from. Today's menu:

- Rice: white, brown, fried.
- Gyoza and giant eggrolls. The gyoza were passable, but my eggroll was doughy and had an aftertaste of stale oil. This was the only thing left on my plate when I was done.
- Soups: miso and some tofuey things. Tried the miso; quite standard.
- Yakisoba.
- Today's special: dduk bok ki (stir fried rice dumplingy things). I don't have a frame of reference for these, but I liked them. Chewy, though.
- Teriyaki: chicken, spicy chicken, pork, tofu. The chicken was well executed: well charred, light on the sauce. The spicy chicken went great with the dduk bok ki. The pork was also good; not the usual teriyaki flavor profile.
- Chinese dishes: 'Mongolian' beef, kung pao chicken.
- Foliage: cold stir-fried vegetables, salad bar.
- Fried eggs. Yay. But then you realize you're paying $5.99/lb for eggs. Boo. (Note to self: never calculate cost per weight at a breakfast restaurant.)

I might be missing a few things, but you get the idea. On the whole, they have some good dishes and some mediocre dishes. Probably decent value for money if you have a small appetite; if you're really hungry, you're better off going to a standard teriyaki place and getting a giant pile of meat and rice for about the same price. In my case, the meal came to a little over $9 including tax."
198,4,"The fours stars are based primarily on the delicious fig/pancetta/arugula pizza - the pizza was five star. Fantastic crust that was a bit thicker than I usually like but it was so tasty I didn't mind at all. The toppings were first rate (although I would have cubed the pancetta for best flavor distribution) and it was cooked perfectly.

Other stuff about the visit. Although the restaurant looked half empty at 5:30 we were offered a choice of eating at the bar or outside. Since it was chilly outside we were reticent but with their heat lamps it was actually pleasant. Service was good. 

The salads were fine but not as tasty as they sounded. The vegan ""charcuterie"" was disappointing.

The sardines sounded fabulous - will return to try those out."
199,4,"Holy color spectrum. It's definitely sensory overload walking into this place - the brightest restaurant I've ever visited.   That's not necessarily a bad thing - it depends on your mood. It was my mother's birthday and she wanted to go somewhere fun with her girls, so Distrito was right on. 
There's not enough that can be said about attentive service. My sister is on a very shitty diet (no salt) before undergoing some testing and the staff was more than happy to accommodate her and her crap situation. 

Lots of plate-clearing going on, which is great when you're in a tapas-style restaurant and each person is advised to order at least 3 dishes. As for the food, it was tasty. Pulpo ceviche and duck tacos (even without added salt) were fantastic. We also shared the hurache special for the evening: topped with morrels, truffles, poblano cream.

Go here with a group or maybe a first date. Or when your mom turns 51 and wants a shot of life.

*Have to add the following, in response to a previous review about Distrito...

1-Garces himself created the menu at El Vez when he worked for Starr, so really he's recreating his first Mexican restaurant that was funded by someone else

2-VW bugs are THE car in Mexico City and surrounding areas. They make them like they never left the assembly line. I lived there (and I know Garces visited there to conceptualize the place) so I can attest to its relevance in a Mexican restaurant."
200,3,Goat cheese and lox toast was amazing!!! Service i must say was slow in the beginning but then improved as we went along....overall ..... i would go again!
201,4,"I found this place on MenuPages and I'm so glad that I found it!  I usually have ""Oeuf Columbus"" and it's just delicious, the best ratatouille.  The crepes are to die for.  Over all, the food here is phenomenal. I've never had a complaint regarding the food.

However, there is always a LONG wait for your food, even when the place isn't packed you still have to wait quite a while for your food to be ready. 

I've also noticed the staff is not that friendly, or ""warm"" and they're quite slow to take your order. If I'm not mistaken the owner is the gentlemen that makes the crepes. So if I were him, I'd hire different staff and possible expand the kitchen staff. 

I usually try to come in VERY early so that I can get my food quickly."
202,4,"Big slice of pizza.  Tastes good.  Oil was dripping off the end of my crust.  Too bad if you order a large pie, they have to break it up into several boxes.  It would be nice if they can get a huge box to fit one whole pie into it.."
203,5,"I've only gotten food to go from this place, but when I go in, it looks like a great place to bring some friends. The food has always been good. I especially recommend the soft chicken tacos and dessert churros are FANTASTIC!

Definitely try this place out at least once."
204,3,Great food but a little pricey!
205,4,"I had always assumed that food at the middle east was an afterthought, but this is not the case at zuzu.  For an excellent value go for the platters, the veggie is good but the meat is better, or better still get both and share between three people.  The service is great, the place gets full but doesn't seem cramped."
206,3,"I've eaten at Pho La Jolla three times now.  The service has been consistently good, the food decent - This is another of the many generic fast-service Vietnamese lunch-oriented places that have appeared since the influx of the famous Boat People of the 1970s forever changed the San Diego cuisine scene for the better.

The location is very convenient for me, just a short drive from my office if I don't have time to go to my favorite Pho place in Mira Mesa, where the food is a level better IMO and the prices significantly lower.  If Pho La Jolla had opened back in the 1980s it would have been a smash hit and immediately overrun by the foodie and UCSD communities.

I'm glad that Pho La Jolla is there.  I'm sure to go there occasionally, knowing exactly what to expect and to be pretty sure of being back at work in a reasonable amount of time.

Parking is in short supply, but I have always managed.  I wouldn't try to go there right at or after noon.  Get there early, or for a late lunch and you'll be fine."
207,3,"The theater is O.K. the snacks are average, the movies are WAY overpriced. It seems very odd to me that a movie theater in a town with 7 colleges does not give student discount tickets... they might actually get people to go there if they did!"
208,4,"Had a recent visit, and the hosts have improved significantly."
209,4,"French Toast... absolutely damn great
Potatoe Cake, though small, again... damn great

From the delicious dishes, to the great staff... this place has all the right ingredients for returning customers. It sucks its been a lil while since I been here cause I forgot the waitress's name but she was solid, and a had a smile and attitude to die for. And I usually ask for the name of who's serving me and she was surprised I asked cause no one asks.... so to all out there, know the name of who's serving you and of course tip.

The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the outside patio that was covered & heated due to Winter, but if it weren't the heated ceiling warmers getting to you, it was the cold when it was turned off.

I'm definitely coming back here when I get back out to Western, Mass"
210,2,"A bunch of friends and I went here to celebrate my birthday, it was a 13 party table but we had called ahead in advance to let them know we were coming on a Saturday night, etc. First off - the beer menu is amazing... but right then and there we hit a problem, about 6 of the beers that people ordered were out of stock - total math was 6/9 different types of beer (not everyone was drinking) were apparently out of stock. I should also mention before my next critique that the place was remarkably dead for a Saturday night - it was my party of 13 and 2 other parties of 2 in the entirety of the pub. 

That being said, the service was remarkably terrible, the waitress didn't end up writing anything down and constantly kept forgetting both drinks and food. At one point after she brought out all the food she asked two of my friends if they'd like something, one of them pointed out that he'd in fact already ordered when everyone else did and was still waiting for his Shephard's pie - his girlfriend just didn't bother wondering if her mac and cheese would even be brought out... after 3 hours of us being there it was not - but at least they didn't try and bill us for it. Overall the wait-staff is absolutely terrible, I understand we were a large party but it was absolutely dead with 3 waitresses on only one helping us and if you're going to not write down orders then at least remember them - no one is going to judge you if you have to write something down to get it correctly (or at least I won't). For the level of business they seemed to be experiencing it would have been nice to not wait up to 30 minutes for the beer we ordered between trying to flag the waitress down from texting on her phone to waiting to hear that ""sorry we're out of x"".

I should also mention that this place is NOT cheap - at least on the menu there is a good beer selection (if they have it that is) but the prices are definitely geared towards brown/risd students and those who can afford the inflated east side residences. That being said I'd say you're better off exploring beer via beeradvocate.com and yankee spirit liquors in Attleboro, MA for a cheaper and more efficient experience."
211,4,"Food Coma Heaven!!!!!!

Yeah so this place is really greasy, and it feels like you have eaten like 2000 calories worth of food if you finish in one sitting. However, if you do not care about your health in anyway and are willing to sacrifice it in the name of food, then sir or madam EJ's the place to do that.

I came here and I got a combo that included an oreo shake, fries, and a texan burger and I wanted to go off to sleep after that fat meal. The oreo shake was good and tasty and it wasn't too thick to the point where its hard to suck in the shake (I am talking about you in'n out). The texan burger was good with all its little fix in s and the fires were excellent some of the best I had in a while. I wasn't too crazy though for their sauce or whatever, I though it was kind of thick and too sweet for my tastes but that's just me tehe.

Next time I wanna try there cheesy balls and maybe not get an artery clogging shake hehe"
212,5,"I've just returned home from my first visit at Douglas J eXchange and it won't be my last!

The salon was practically empty when I went in, but only because I booked one of the earliest appointments available (9:15am).

The reception staff was very friendly. She offered to take my coat and grab me a beverage (tea/coffee/water) and brought me to the waiting area.

My stylist Amber was great, I really liked her and will definitely book with her again. She was very friendly and pleasant but most of all really listened to what I was looking for and took time looking at my hair before delving into the wash/cut.

A bonus of this salon is they use Aveda products, which are completely organic and very light on your hair - you'll never feel weighed down using Aveda. Plus, you're choosing an earth-friendly product so it's a win-win.

I can't think of anything that would have made my experience better, so I'm giving this salon 5/5. Highly recommend."
213,5,roark and rob are great.
214,3,"Came on a Saturday last December and had a glass of wine and some appetizers.  The calamari was okay but the roasted cauliflower soup was amazing!  Okay, so it's a wine place but I'm not much of a wine buff and I won't pretend to be one by commenting on it.  One thing I would like to try another time is their wine pairings, which a group next to me was enjoying and looking snooty while doing so.  Yes, I'm snarky because I want to be snooty like them one day.  The overall vibe is pretty chill and there was live-music that night that wasn't annoyingly loud and still made your conversations audible (big plus).  The crowd is a bit older, so I wouldn't exactly come here for a crazy time.  It's more of a quiet and relaxing spot, which might equal romantic to some."
215,4,"Great burgers..I must say, I ordered the 1/4lb it's applewood smoked bacon and ham. After gettig stuck in elevator 2 in he parking lot it was very fulfilling but not as good as the bucket on eagle rock blvd :D"
216,5,"Accidentally wrote a review for the Bella Pita on Westwood Blvd, ironically I've never been to that location, despite how often I frequent the UCLA BP on Gayley! Bella Pita is my jam! I come here at least twice a week, usually getting a Chicken Wowshi if I'm sharing with my girlfriend, or a Steak Pita if I'm eating alone.

The wowshi is the filling of your choice, baked inside pita dough, sort of like a calzone. Something I've learned is always to put sauce on the meat first before the toppings, or else you'll just have a dry few last bites.

I always dress my wowshi with a bit of white sauce, hummus, and herbal dressing, before piling on Pico de Gallo, onions, and cucumbers, before adding some hot sauce, pepperoncinis, and then a little more white sauce.

While many rave about the fried cauliflower, I can tell you as a regular that the fries are way better, especially with ""Bella Sauce"", made with 3 parts white sauce, and 1 part ""Really Hot Sauce.""

Bella Pita is honestly good any time of the day, and I've definitely had it thrice in one day (lunch, dinner, drunchies)."
217,4,"Bella Mia's new location houses its great fashion finds as well as home decor items. Though its styles are generally a bit more mature than what a college student would wear, I was able to find a couple pairs of shoes as a college student - it still has something for everyone. The prices are naturally higher than other chain stores, but that should be expected when shopping at a boutique.

When I visited for my first time, the staff was incredibly helpful and multiple women helped me find what i was looking for. They offer a great deal of higher-end clothing items that are hard to find in the C-U area. The best part about it for me, which isn't advertised, is that they offer a student discount of 20% (a big deal for a college student)!"
218,3,"A hamburger is a hamburger.

This is more a tourist desitination that a local place for a good burger.

Service is whacky and rude!

Usually you are lined up outside and freezing while you place your order and told it will be ready once you are seated.

AND once you are seated....you are next to a table of annoying people..squeezed in, and the place is overheated.

So come out of the cold, have a mediocre burger, and sweat your ass off next to some strange Japanese tourist who read about the place in OUT Boston!

The only good thing about this place is that all of the burgers can be done with a veggie burger patty."
219,5,"When I saw the signs on the street pointing to this place, I was expecting the typical joint needing lots of street signage to coerce people in the door. I was pleasantly surprised when I followed those signs in to an upscale vibe of a place that was bright and clean, as opposed to the stained carpeted barely clean, type of place that you find all over University Ave. and Sacramento St. Well, the food was the clincher for my 5 stars. I came in at 2pm and had just come from an AMAZING free lecture by the fabulous Amy Goodman at UC Berkeley, happened to be arranged by student Sarah Porter, thank you Sarah P.!. So, I just wanted a snack. Opting for a la carte instead of the tempting buffet at only $7.99, I ordered a simple samosa and chai. Both were fresh, light, crisp, and really quite good. It definitely whetted my appetite for trying more of this place when I'm in my typical craving for indian food state of mind, which hits me about once a month. Punjabi--I'll be back, with family in tow. Loved my first experience here!"
220,4,"Everything's expensive here. Books are expensive (textbooks and recreational), the boutique is expensive, the computer store is expensive, and the USC gear is expensive. If you can stomach all that, it's great. It's a small bookstore that tries to be a mall. It fails at that, but hey, if you need a last-minute-birthday-gift or something to protect your keyboard, or pretty much anything else that you can't get at the Dollar store and need ASAP, it can be a lifesaver."
221,1,"I've shopped here quite a few times over the past ten years. I finally decided to have a reading. (I forgot her name but it began with an ""A"").  What a joke and what a fake! Half of the reading was like a counseling session and the other half she obviously faked seeing angels and deceased loved ones.. Then she charged me for the extra time she wasted looking for her therapist's phone number. 
Save your money; open the newspaper and read your horoscope instead!"
222,3,"Since the indian restruant we were trying to go closed early. We end up to try this Thai Restrurant. The Chicken Satay is very good. I would give a 4 star if I only had the chicken satay. I wanted to try some curry. Since I had a sore throat after a 2 hour long negociation, I picked Tofu Pad Thai instead. Unlike many other Thai restruant using fried Tofu, they were using freash tofu. That's a plus, but the minus part is the Tofu is not very tasty and the sauce is too sweet. On the other hand, my friend liked his pork curry dish."
223,3,"When I was in college I never suggested Murphy's but always ended up there because friends worked there. Decent food, semi-cheap, good strong drinks (if you know the bartenders) and decent specials. After 12 there are definitely lines Thursday-Saturday nights, it's usually one in, one out. If you get a booth, it's a good place to chill out, play card games, indulge in some greasy-ness and hang with friends. The music is pretty loud for a laid back bar, so you will leave with a hoarse voice, but oh well. An added bonus is they have photo hunt."
224,4,"Come here on a easygoing work day for a quick slice from time to time. Single slices are cheap and huge. Lunch specials are appropriately priced and will definitely fill you up. Chicago pizza is supreme. 

However, last time we ordered some take out, and there was basically a layer of oil soaking through the box from one of their white pizzas. Left a mess in the conference room. Please be less greasy!"
225,4,"I want a heart attack and I want it now.

The Fat Jerry: the fillings weren't nearly as hot as I was anticipating.  I expected long strands of melty mozzarella cheese and ooey gooey insides from the eggs.  The inside: medium temperature cheese stick with a not so hot egg.  Perhaps I was expecting too much (it was my first time and I totally hyped it up through yelp)  The philly meat was really really good but it just wasn't hot enough for me!! 

Seasoned Fries with Fat Sauce: can I get a bucket of these?/ THESE ARE SOO GOOD. Skinny fries with a perfectly crunchy outside and creamy interior.  I equally loved dipping them into the fat sauce. SO GOOD. I LOVE THE FAT SAUCE!! even if it makes me fatter. sigh. 

Cheese Fries:  these were good but honestly a tad bland for my taste. I also wish the fries were a tad crunchier, but because the cheese needed to be  melted I understand. :) 

Summary: LOVE THE FRIES and that is all."
226,4,"Since the original review, I've been to this location several more times, and it's definitely smoothed out the opening-week kinks. The cashiers are also now handing out sample cups - a major plus for anyone (ahem, everyone) who can't decide which flavor to get!"
227,4,"When my friend told me that she wanted to have breakfast here, I wasn't sure what to expect. It's called a coffee shop and my mind wandered with ordering food at a Starbucks-type of venue. As we pulled up to the storefront, it seemed unassuming as well. Wasn't sure what was supposed to be so special about this place.

And then we opened the door and stepped back in time. My God, this place looked awesome! It wasn't a coffee shop, it was an old diner! Apparently, this restaurant has been around for 70 years and was used as a location for Mad Men recently.

But you aren't reading the review to find out about their awesome decor. You want to know about the food. Definitely worth the visit! I tried their chorizo breakfast plate and was left very satisfied both in quantity and quality. It was so delicious that I scarfed it down, let it left me full for several hours. Om nom nom! A friend of mine ordered pancakes and eggs, which he said were delicious and the pancakes looked very thick and fluffy.

Do I recommend a trip down to Andy's Coffee Shop? Yes. Yes, I do. But make sure you get there before 3pm. That's when they close."
228,4,Great place for their kebabs. I love their friendly friendly service. And they're super sweet! The owner is very nice making sure you get a table right away. There food is large on scale and the price very reasonable for what you get. You'll surely be full. They give you humus etc.. for free as well as soup and salad bar free.... It's a little ridiculous.
229,1,"We've avoided OM almost since it opened based on a couple of bad experiences, one where we were in the lounge around 6PM not long after it first opened and seated ourselves near the window. Shortly afterward we were yelled at for sitting there because the lounge window spot was ""reserved."" Irritated, we moved to the bar and had our drinks. An HOUR later a group of Harvard hipsters waltzed in and took that spot--clearly the window spot was saved for the pretty, richer looking people. So we knew there was attitude.

A few months later I was trying to arrange for our holiday party...about 20 people. I called many weeks in advance, reserved a spot for 6:30 (we had employees who had kids and didn't want to be out late). Originally that was fine but two days later they called me to tell me they could only put us in at 8PM on a Tuesday. No apologies, no nothing. I said no way and booked us at Dante instead where we had an incredible, no attitude, hassle free meal. 

So for a couple of years now my husband and I have pointedly avoided OM even though we had never actually eaten there. Yesterday we were looking for an outdoor lunch spot and when we saw there was a couple of tables open, we decided to take the plunge and see if perhaps we were mistaken about the place. 

Unfortunately, no. Terrible, slow service and a mostly absent waiter (although when he did show up he was friendly enough).  Took forever to get our drinks (which were the ONLY saving grace of the meal--very delish cocktails) and therefore forever for our order to be taken. Then they messed up my husband's appetizer, so he watched me eat my food while we waited for his to show, then I watched him eat his appetizer. Always a great way to start a meal, no? 

Then the wait for our entree...the very very long wait. Completely absent waiter. Then, when the food arrived, it was cold. I had sliders and the buns were hard, meat was cold and my fries were barely warm. Sent it back, which I RARELY ever do in restaurants. My husband's chicken curry sandwich was barely warm and the bread was soggy but by then he was just ticked and wanted to get out of there so didn't say anything. I watched him eat his meal, then when my hot sliders arrived (with bizarrely, cooked many hours before, super hard brioche buns) he watched me eat my meal.  Our clueless waiter came by in the meantime to ask if we wanted another round of drinks and I had to point out that I really just wanted my food hot and was waiting for the second plate to arrive. He said, ""oh I'm sorry, no one ever told me about that!"" then went off to see what the story was. I watched the manager brush by him with my new slider plate, clearly irritated. So it seems that there is no communication in the back of the house.

Took forever to get water at our table and then only because I made some off-handed comment about it when a different waitress was serving water to her table and I think she overheard me and brought us some. 

After my husband watched me finish my meal we had to wait another ten minutes to get the check. While we were signing it, completely ticked off that they didn't apologize or comp us anything for all the mishaps, the clueless waiter was talking to two women who sat down next to us. One woman asked how the chicken curry sandwich was. Clueless waiter says, ""oh, just ask him, he had it..."" and turns to my husband (UMMMM at this point you should know we're unhappy...why on earth would you ask us to talk up something to another customer??). 

So my normally restrained husband proceeds to tell the two women how our food arrived cold and terrible. She immediately changed her mind and ordered the salad. 

The waiter, as we were leaving, said, ""it's only through feedback that we're going to get better.""

So here it is OM, feedback. Your food and your service just plain suck."
230,2,"There doesn't seem to be a lot in the brunch family of eateries in the Central Square area which is why I picked this place. As other reviewers have said, the service was pretty bad; we ended up sitting outside, which was fine, but then why weren't we seated when we first arrived, since the table had been free the whole time? Also I noticed the waitress took our order at the same time that she took the order of the people sitting next to us -- who had sat down about 5-10 minutes before us. We showed up at noon and were seated at 12:17, which isn't that bad for a busy brunch place, but seems silly when you see that there are empty tables right there in front of you...

It took another 10 minutes after ordering for coffee to arrive and when it did, it came without milk or sugar. The wait staff seems willing but not very detail-oriented. The seater guy was very nice and kept saying ""thanks for waiting;"" but all I could think was, if you trained the staff better, we wouldn't have had to wait...!

I had the french toast with fresh fruit -- served without syrup or honey or anything -- and while it was fairly tasty it wasn't superb and not worth waiting all that time for. My friend had the omelet which looked perfectly fine. The apple cider, though, was really delicious. The coffee was only okay -- it tasted a bit acrid like it had been sitting around a bit, or the bean was over-extracted. It came to $31 for two of us before tip.

All in all, I have better ways to spend my Sundays! If I do go there next time I'll probably make reservations."
231,4,"This is a dive bar, and if you don't like dive bars you won't like this one - so keep it moving. I myself like dive bars and I happen to live right around the corner from this one. There is really nothing about the actual bar itself that is special, its the people in it. Tina is my favorite bartender there. Some of the others are cool too but when I walk through those doors the face I want to see behind that bar is hers. The security staff are also great. They make me feel safe AND welcome. I often bump into people I know there, fellow service industry folk etc. I love that. I can walk into that bar by myself but never be alone. The thing that makes a dive bar great and better or different from the others really is the people."
232,4,"Stopped in here based on reviews by other Yelpers.  

We both tried the Buffalo Burger, which came on an Italian roll with cheese, grilled onion, lettuce tomato and mayo.  Catsup and Mustard were provided at the table.  The rest of the plate was covered in large, freshly cooked potato chips. 

When I see a place with this many motorcycles outside, I expect good beer and entertainment, but not usually great food.

I was surprised.  The Buffalo burger was exceptional. Well-cooked, juicy with just enough condiments to add to it while still allowing you to taste the meat.  

The chips were excellent.

I'd definitely go here again, though when we went by it at night, there wasn't a parking space left open."
233,5,"I love this place. There service is great. All staff are friendly. How can you beat tradition?
I took my boyfriend here since he had never been and he wondered why i had waited so long.
It is just one of those places you have to try.
Their Zucchini bread is so good.
Get one of their quesadillas to share! So delicious...
I have never been disappointed, and I have to drive from Ventura County to eat here! Totally worth it..."
234,5,"My Nail lady Diana works here and i love her very much.  This is a cute little salon and spa.  I have heard good things about the spa ladies although i haven't had a treatment personally.  They have some good stylists.  Celina used to own her own salon and has many repeat customers, she is very skilled and experienced.  Fatima is so stylish and I see a lot of customers she does look great when they leave."
235,2,"I called Chipotle to find out if they serve organic food, and was told that what they serve is organic or natural. Yesterday, I ate there and asked about the corn salsa. It is GMO corn, and I can't believe that a restaurant that says it is all about healthy, natural food is serving GMO's. I would like it a lot more if there was no corn salsa and Chipotle's was not feeding us food with ingredients that will negatively impact our health. 

I like their food and the premise that it is healthy. Chipotle needs to clean up your act and serve only decent, healthy food to your customers, if that is what  you are going to call it."
236,4,"I'd never had Cambodian food (never seen one in Chicago) and this place was recommended by a colleague so we checked it out while traveling for work.

The place looks and feels like your typical college town Indian/Thai restaurant - renovated small old house with a kitchen somewhere in the back.  The menu looks pretty similar to Thai as well - curies, rice dishes, tom kha, tom yum, etc.  I tried the Green Curry which is my usual benchmark dish at Thai restaurants and was impressed.  Cambodian curry is has similar flavors and spices to Thai, the only  major different being that the coconut milk is used much more sparsely if not at all.   I love coconut milk, but this was a nice change because the milk can sometimes overpower the underlying flavors and spices.  

I like things spicy, so we asked for the maximum spice level which was ""XXX"".  It was moderately hot, but pretty tame from my experiences with a range of Thai food.  I could have used another ""X"" or two.  Make my lips burn.

Good food, good atmosphere, and a solid choice for an Thai-like ethnic cuisine Providence."
237,4,"Let's start this off with a special link:
http://www.atl-list.com/events/vanquish-nightclub-friday-night/26.aspx

USE THIS LINK TO GRAB A SPOT ON THE GUEST LIST.

Now that we got that out of the way, let's begin the review. A gorgeous place! Although one may assume that tigers and ladies on the walls may seem tacky when you first hear about it, you will actually notice that it was executed well with its presence. The furniture that were nicely placed in the VIP areas looked to be made of beautiful Italian leather and complimented the decor. The flashy chandeliers that hung all across the ceilings begged the night to be as over the top as possible. Everything from the moldings to the wonderfully printed wallpaper and choices of colors flowed together in a unison of a perfectly elegant pattern. This may be the best decorated place in Atlanta.

The location is a breeze to find with plenty of parking to be found all around the surrounding area, although it may be $15-$20 to have the privilege. The crowd seems to be of a different breed every night. Friday nights usually consist of an Asian crowd while Saturdays appear to cater to an older collective crowd. The cover is usually $10-$20 without the guest list, with ladies being free nowadays.Drinks are moderately poured and are charged at premium prices, and this is to be expected with its location and offerings. Dress code is extremely strict, and this is also to expected when attending such a night club.

The patrons seem to be friendly (most of the time), and can be obnoxious when needed to be. This is a smoke free night club, so smoking is only available out back. Music tends to focus on electro house remixes of a lot of the top 40 and some popular EDM. The sound system is suitable for a place of it's size without being obnoxiously loud. Most people seem to be enjoy their drinks and not really dancing much. It's a lounge after all, but there are still a few that like to move to the music.

Reserving a VIP may be time consuming as they do not always respond promptly via email and phone. It's a two bottle minimum with 250 per bottle.

Whenever I go to Vanquish, I enjoy myself thoroughly even though I may have to spend a pretty penny to do so. The people are beautiful and the drinks are pricey, yet I'll be returning for the guaranteed good night."
238,4,"I thought UBurger would be more like be.good or Ufood Grill. Similar, but I didn't get ""healthy"" from this place. Maybe I'm misreading how it's billed. 
Either way though... the food was pretty good.  I had a Udog with the works and onion rings. The dog was delicious... packed with onions, pickles... something they call banana rings... ?? The onion rings were really good as well. 
With a drink it was $6 and I was super full. I'll be back to try a burger."
239,3,"When a restaurant claims to be the best, I have some pretty high expectations. This place did not meet my expectations. The burgers were just ok, the sweet potato fries were just ok, too. The place is really cramped and you basically sit on top of other people and have to share condiments with the table next to you.

While there are many varieties of burgers, it's all about whether or not the basic cheeseburger melts in your mouth...well, it doesn't. This place has interesting decor and offers a good overall experience, but it is definitely not the place to go if you're looking for the perfect, juicy burger."
240,4,"Sara H sums it up better than I can or will.

Clearly, it is an Au Bon Pain and I never go to another one, but this one my fiance go to most weeks after Mass.  Oddly, there is a good atmosphere.  Old folks going there as a regular thing, a few troubled people enjoying a non-judgemental atmosphere, a few scholars and a rather snooty Brit when I am there.

Somehow, it is rather nice."
241,4,"My family and I decided to try this exotic restaurant for the Yelp Eats week. We made the right choice after several discussions on which restaurant to choose. Although the Yelp Eats promo offered a three course meal for an unbeatable price, upon scanning over the everyday menu we decided to go with the Family Dinner. It was a five course dinner for $30 dollars a person. We were hungry so decided to opt for the larger portion of food. The only catch was that each course was selected by the Chef. However we were able to choose our soup and dessert. The waitress kindly allowed up to choose 2 entrees (there were 4 of us participating in the Family Dinner) from the menu. In addition she accepted our request for ""no fish"" entrees. We feasted on 4 different varieties from each course. We started off with a choice of lamb and lentil soup or vegetarian. Both were very good. Next we had an avocado and tomato salad, orange salad, eggplant salad, and smoked salmon salad. All were outstanding. The appetizers served were a Moroccan style ceviche, some sort of hummus like spread, a pastry with some sort of spinach and cheese mixture, and another delicious meat/pastry app. By this time we were beginning to feel full but had yet to receive our surprise entrees. Our entrees consisted of the Lamb Tagine (rack of lamb in a ginger broth), quail over a bed or raisin rice, lamb kabobs, and a chicken with vegetables dish. The chicken and lamb were a little dry but tasty nonetheless. The rice is out of this world! So much that my boyfriend had a little to much even though he stays away from carbohydrates and sugar most of the time...and paid the price a little later on. He still says he could eat that rice everyday...it was just that good. After no more room for dessert we still continued on to the fifth course. I have to say that it was one of the most amazing chocolate mousse cakes I've ever had. We weren't sure what the other dessert was (and neither did the manager) as she described it as a strawberry smoothie. It was good but we weren't quite sure what we were eating. Finally we finished our meal with a specialty hot tea which definitely cleansed the palate after all those flavors. An extra perk to the delicious food was the entertainment. They have belly dancers shaking their hips to lively music. Due to the small cozy size of the restaurant it became a little warm after the place was filled with more customers. We were seated at one of the tables closest to the restrooms...it was either there or at table which was two steps away from the front door. I would definitely recommend the Family Style Dinner if you're not familiar with the menu and are dining with a group. The staff gives you plenty of time to enjoy your food and take a breather between courses. After all it took us three hours to consume five courses."
242,5,"This place is excellent for the food quality and quantity at low prices! I like this place a lot because you can get  a la carte items at low prices which basically lets you assemble your own plate filled with delicious good food.

I always get the grilled chicken burrito with chicken flauta. Chips and salsa are delivered even before you order and they are delicious. I really like the chipotle salsa! I ordered their sangria on Friday and it was pretty good.

Overall, the food is well made and the service is quick. One of my favorite spots in Berkeley for cheap lunch/dinner."
243,4,"Went to Thelonius Monkfish last night and had a nice, enjoyable meal.  The sushi (Alaska Roll) was fresh and recommended; will definitely try some more of the roll options at my next visit.

The fried Monkfish Fried Rice and crispy chicken pad thai were also good choices - light and excellent taste.  

I would also recommend the crispy, coconut french fries!"
244,2,"The Silver Skillet is proof that there is no shortage of people who want to eat mediocre food in historical buildings. I can only presume that the reviewers who have lauded this place as ""the best breakfast in Atlanta"" are using the Fulton County Jail and the Atlanta Community Food Bank as comparison. Needless to say, I'd be hard pressed to recommend this place for anything beyond a single novelty visit.

Food: Silver Skillet is a traditional diner that specializes in standard, no-frills southern breakfast and lunch fare. The breakfast menu is comprised of items such as grilled pork chops, country ham, beef hash, hamburger steak, pancakes, and omelets.  My standby entree here is the old fashioned buttermilk pancakes topped with bananas. The dish is by no means memorable or impressive; however, from a foodborne disease standpoint, it's preferable to anything involving meat or eggs. 

Service: The Silver Skillet has been around since 1956 and little has changed since, including the waitresses. They exude an aura of southern hospitality, but deep down they're really just a harem of silver-topped honey badgers who really don't give a shit. 

Atmosphere: Some might use the term ""nostalgic"", but I think a more appropriate adjective would be ""crusty"". Everything from the tables to the menus is covered with a film that inevitably leaves me with the desire to take a shower upon exit.   

Cost: Inexpensive, which is the sole reason I'll oblige most visitors' requests to dine here. Breakfast and lunch specials range in price between $7 and $10, while sides range in price between $3 and $6.   

Other:  The Silver Skillet is open for breakfast and lunch only. Hours of operation are Monday-Friday, 6:30AM-2:30PM and Saturday-Sunday, 8:00AM-2:00PM. Also, as other reviewers have noted, there is no hostess, so patrons are left with the responsibility of securing their own tables on a first-come, first-served basis."
245,5,"Warm Cookies? Check.
Great ice cream? Check.
Cheap? Check.

This plas is an amazing bite to get when you have that sugar craving. It's cheap and the ice cream sandwiches are awesome. The line can get kind of long towards the weekend, so expect to have some wait time here and there. I recommend the salted caramel ice cream."
246,4,"Hard to believe that this is run by a university food service. This gastropub is owned by USC Hospitality and replaced their aging (and awful) Traditions bar with a more contemporary and accessible hang out for students, faculty, staff and downtowners in the area. 

The decor is modern with clean white marble and black slate tops, polished aluminum chairs, wood benches and an open, airy feel. While I don't think it goes creative enough with the laboratory theme (chalkboards and science textbooks are far too literal), it is a great space in an of itself. 

They have quite a selection of beers including some specialty house beers like Trojan Blonde (bland), The Lab Amber Lager (good), and Red Trolley Ale (very good). These are served in beakers, while the other brews are served in regular tumblers. Don't look for your standard beer. Despite having a huge beer selection, Miller or Bud is not amongst them.

I've been there a few times - the first a week after they opened. The food at that time was very inconsistent. Especially bad was the artichoke fritters. It was oily and soggy. However, the last time I was there, they changed the recipe and it was quite good. Overall, they have evened out the food quality and got the kitchen under control. The prices are inline with what you'd expect from a gastropub type of upscale bar menu. Not overly expensive, but not cheap either.

The service is friendly. I asked if they were students, but she said most of them are not. However, they are not well trained. I ordered a half bottle of wine, but when the server brought it out, she didn't know how to use the wine opener. Another time I went for an event, and I asked the hostess (or she could have been a server at the front) about it, she said she didn't know and would get the manager. Perhaps they can train them to open the binder and look at information. That is all that the manager did to get me the information.

I'm going to be on the forgiving side since they are new. I enjoyed my time there and they showed definite improvement between the first and second visit. I think they will clean up the service end as well. And really, if you are in the area, there is very little choice. The only other nice place to go is Bacaro which is great for wine and vibe, but with very small-portioned expensive food.

I'll also let you in on a secret about parking that isn't widely publicized. There is parking behind the building off of Flower that is reserved for the restaurants in that building. And as far as I can tell, almost no one uses it. So rather than pay the meter (before 8 pm), first check the back."
247,2,"Eaten here twice, delivery both times.  First time was really good, hence the second time.  Ordered the italian beef, chicago dog, and fries.  It took over an hour and a half to get here - called the restaurant after an hour and the driver had been pulled over.  They supposedly re-made the food and sent it out again, but the dog was cold and the fries were old.  I called and spoke with the manager who basically said too bad.   So, in the end, I guess decent cheap food, but no concern about customer service."
248,4,I love this place. I have only tried the the Tandoori chicken meal but it is so flavorful and a great amount of food for 10.99 lol you can order online which I love and I enjoy the naan. The ambiance of the place is an old diner or train cart and they are always so pleasant. Also the chic pea side is soo yummy and I appreciate the salad side it just adds a refreshing kick to the balanced meal. Def try this place
249,1,"I guess you have to give a star to every establishment on yelp in order to leave a review, so i'll designate this 1 star to 3 decent things here - Their chicken, tortilla chips and their house salsa.  Sadly, all three are not enough to ever bring me back though.  

This place made my love for Chipotle grow stronger.  The difference in the quality of freshness and ingredients are WAY off.  Chipotle actually tastes fresh, Freebird tastes like everything was made days ago and was just taken out of the fridge RIGHT before plating it in your bowl or burrito.  

-   Nothing behind the glass looked fresh while she was filling up my bowl
-  The scooper they use for each item....was SOOO FREAKIN SMALL!  Kids
    sized ladles!  
-  Their cheese was so cold and looked processed from a bag.  
-  Their corn salsa looked like dried shriveled corn, no flavor also.
-  Their steak was chewy as hell.
-  Their lime cilantro rice tasted like a cardboard box, HORRIBLE!
-  The restaurant looked dirty and grimey as f@ck.  Chairs and tables were 
    greasy and sticky.  I even semi-slipped on some death hot sauce on the
    floor.  DEATH!

Looked like college kids all work here to make ends meet.  They aren't really about the quality of customer service, I don't blame them though, this place sucks mucho-balls.

This place was so overpriced it killed me inside after i paid and ate it.  $20 and some change for 2 burrito bowls a mini tray of SMASHED bits of chips and a soda.  You get freshness, more food, better quality and a better price at Chipotle.  Never again Freebird."
250,2,"Our waitress was probably up there on my list of worst dining experiences. Not only did she take over 30 minutes to bring us our drinks (because she was drinking herself at the bar), she forgot my order when she brought everyone's food out - at least an hour after we had ordered. And I only ordered a toasted English muffin, which took another 30 minutes to finally get to the table.

The atmosphere is hip and the interior is cozy for a small group of friends, but set aside a lot of time if you really want to try out this bar."
251,5,AMAZING. DELECTABLE. DELICIOUS!!!!! the most AMAZING food i have EVER tasted! They make vegetables taste better than ANYTHING i have ever tasted!! it is hands down my favorite restaurant ever. Romaine salad (seasonal) is my FAVORITE!! the roasted chicken is amazing to.
252,2,"Star-worthy: Honored a competitor's coupon. Spent lots of time on my nails (which might have been because I was the only person in the shop for the first 45 minutes). No television makes the ambience fairly relaxing.

Not so star-worthy: Cut my cuticle and made my finger bleed for about an hour. The wooden barrel they soaked my feet in and the music were ... odd. Even with the coupon, still pretty expensive ($27 for a mani/pedi)."
253,5,"I actually usually go to the location in Wellesley but... I love Beauty and Main because it stocks many hard to find brands. It's great going to one place and being able to pick up Diptyque Candles, Darphin, Creed, and Laura Mercier.The intimate setting is great. I never feel pressured to buy things like I often have in Sak's or Neiman's, and the help is superb. In the past, I have found that places have not understood my needs and style, but the staff at Beauty and Main have always done a great job of suggesting products that usually exceed my expectations."
254,1,Went to this place for breakfast today. My food was cold. I did not like this place. My boyfriends food was cold also. He said even his coffee was cold. Wont go back
255,4,"Subs and crepes, an unlikely combo

An improvement from their other location that was in the International District. UW students are the right crowd for inexpensive foods. I tried the spicy tuna, tomato and egg crepe. Was pretty good. Going to have to work my way through some of the sweet crepes and will report back."
256,4,"4 stars because of the food, not so much the service. 

Not that the service was terrible, it's just that the folks next to us who had the tall, male waiter got much better advice and attention then we did with our short, bob-cut female waitress. We noticed that he (& we will request him next time!) politely offered to stagger the plate delivery to the table of the folks next to us. Our chick didn't, and so she brought it all at once, so, food got cold. We expect a high-end place like this to have consistency in their staff training. stagger it a bit! or ... we should know to only order two plates at a time if they are inept at this basic level of service.

As for the food, most excellent choices were the oysters, fried artichokes, potato croquettes and the eggplant napoleon. fantastic and the food looks just like it does on their website.

tip: get the small 2 dollar bread basket for 3 nice warm rolls, to sop up all the great sauces. the large gets you 4 rolls.
 
drinks: the moulin rougue is like an alcoholic smoothie, delicious and recommended. its tough choosing a drink from the wide selection.

bottom line: nice place for a different sort of up-scale dinner out, as long as you get good service you will leave happy!"
257,4,"I looove Indian food, and this one is a good place for it.  It's not the best place ever, but it's still pretty good.  Be sure you get there before 7pm because after 7 Rice Village is a zoo and there's no parking.  They close after lunch and re-open @ 5pm so don't show up @ 4."
258,5,"I grew up with Roscoes in Los Angeles and later in Long Beach.  When i had the Midnight Train here, it was a shock to the system!.  It blew Roscoes out of the water!  The chicken here is great.  Everything on the menu comes out hot and delicious.  Consistent every time! If you're in the ATL for a weekend or so, please don't forget to stop by for a meal here."
259,3,"We went there in a group for Sunday lunch! 
I wish I went for a full menu, I really don't like buffet that much, most of the food were too spicy for a non Indian.
It was 8$ for lunch, which was reasonable."
260,5,"Just saw Portishead here last night. AMAZING SHOW, btw :) I would give this venue 4.5 stars, if I had the option, but am giving it 5 because I don't. 
The venue was awesome. I loved the outdoor bbq/drinks area - as Canadian, being allowed to take your drinks with you to all parts of the venue is unique! Since this venue is located on the USC campus, free street parking is impossible to find. We lucked out and found a spot a few streets away. You can park in the event parking, but it'll cost you $20. 
The actual interior of the Shrine is old, and nothing fancy. No seats for this show, but some people were sitting on the floor when bands were not playing. The hall was packed, and the upstairs level was, too. I'm 5'7 and had a great view of the stage and video screens - even though I was almost at the back of the downstairs room. Great sound, and good atmosphere! Event staff were super friendly and helpful. 
There are 3 bars inside on the top level, one right at the top of the stairs going up. I would definitely avoiding the first bar you see when you walk upstairs, and recommend getting drinks outside or at one of the bars on the level. I made the mistake of waiting in a huge line for that bar not knowing there were other options on the top level (none of the other ones had lines). If you pay with a credit card you need to spend at least $25, so I was forced to wait in that huge line twice to fill the tab requirements.
Merch booths had big lines, but they moved pretty quick, and bathrooms were empty - even the ladies! Awesome. 
Also - read a review about the danger of the neighborhood.. You definitely drive through some rougher parts of LA to get to the Shrine, depending on where you're coming from, but the actual area surrounding the Shrine is super safe. There's campus 5-0 everywhere, and video cameras on lamp posts. I felt fine walking back to my car at 11pm."
261,5,"I've been a loyal Einstein's Arcade player since 2001. Back then when Le Fun was still around before the Scientologists got to them, Einstein's won me over since they offered DDR games at a cheaper rate (50 cents for four songs, assuming you do not fail) and the crowd is usually more mature. Now that it's just the E on the Drag, they have two DDR machines (5th and 8th mix), of which the older one was most likely purchased from Le Fun. They also have the good ol' 25-cent Street Fighter II consoles, and the fan base holds tournaments for it on occasion.

The layout is more narrow than wide: once you walk in, the arcade units flank either side of you. It's fairly dark, and the employee(s) working the shift may be playing their favorite music over the speakers. You might also hear the phone ring sometimes and see an employee rushing to the back room to answer it. All in all, it's an Austin classic, and its quirks make it endearing, kind of like your favorite cousin.

The verdict: I love this place. Even with the huge combination arcade-restaurant-bar places springing up (like Dave & Buster's and Main Event), Einstein's will always be my arcade of choice because it's way more affordable and isn't gimmicky. The E is all about gameplay!"
262,5,"I just wanted to say, what an excellent experience I had at Rock Bottom. My fiance, now husband, and I had our wedding reception at Rock Bottom in the Pinnacle Room. Our experience was beyond what I expected. I have always enjoyed the restaurant and I didn't want to have our reception at some stuffy wedding event location. The mood of the restaurant is fun and casual, perfect for my non-stuffy self.

The Event Coordinator for Rock Bottom, Shelley, was so professional and went over everything with me thoroughly. She answered all of my questions and made me feel very comfortable. We were able to choose a buffet menu for the reception and there were plenty of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options for it, which meant that all of my guests would be fed and happy. 
 
The Pinnacle Room was perfect! We had a fantastic bartender and servers for our reception. The servers we totally on it. I loved that the room has its own bar and we never had to worry about the servers taking our drink order and disappearing. We had a buffet to have a more low-key feel to our night and it worked out fantastically. We never had to worry about our guests going hungry or thirsty.

I highly recommend the Pinnacle Room for and event. We were so pleased with our evening and it was extremely non-stressful and exactly what we wanted. Thanks again to the crew at Rock Bottom!"
263,2,"I took my Fiance to breakfast here, and this place deserves 4 stars BUT the hostesses at the front stole 2 stars due to their rudness. We walk in and are looked at up and down from the group of 3 galsstanding behind the Hostess desk having a 5 minute personal conversation, we are hopeing to be properly and promply attended.We felt ignored and are left feeling how should i say judged... WAIT we are paying to be here!! We give the old EHEM and are finally ""put on the waiting list"" and not in a friendly manner. There was no reason to be looked at like a highschool girl in pajamas, we both looked nice and smelled nice too, so I dont understand the rude body language towards us by the hostess."
264,4,"I'm a big fan of recycling, so naturally I love this place. The only real frustrating thing for me is when I find something I really, really like and I need either a size up or down - oops! Out of luck, it's the only one. But sometimes that's a blessing in disguise since things can get eliminated and you end up not overspending so much. This is generally not a problem for me since I'm really not that into shopping or patient enough to spend all day sifting through everything. I like to get in and get out. 

The one thing I HATE about this store is taking stuff in to sell. There's often quite a line, and there is nothing more frustrating than lugging a couple of bags in to have them sift through and only take one thing. And ironically enough, the things they say they don't usually buy are the kind of things I look for! One really nice thing is that they've got a donation bin for stuff they don't take - if you tried to sell it on the off chance that you might get a couple of bucks out of it but just want it gone, you can donate it (and not have to lug it home!)."
265,3,"It's pretty good, and we go here because we no longer live close to Yogurtland. If we lived closer to Yogurtland, that's where we'd go.

That being said, there is a decent selection of yogurt flavors, although I've been here three times, and all three times, I've heard people commenting that one of the flavors had run out. The creamy flavors (vanilla, cake batter, etc.) are very delicious. The fruity flavors (tropical, etc.) taste cheap and powdery.

The toppings selection is good as well, but the ones in the middle are hard to reach under the glass guard.

It's good enough that I will continue to go here, but in my opinion it's not the best."
266,4,"I don't know much (anything) about beer, but the reviewers here are being way too tough on the food! I think it's great and I've been to Triumph with a variety of different groups at least a dozen times over the years and am ALWAYS quite satisfied.
All the appetizers are super scrumptious, I have enjoyed the fried calamari and the little pizza thing (I forget what its called) many times. I've had pretty good burgers, and oh yes some truly excellent fancy-style mac and cheese! (I don't think it was on the menu, I was just hankerin' and I asked and they made my dreams come true.)
The service is ok, the place looks cool with towering ceilings, huge metal vats-o-brewin', and an extremely long narrow shape (it used to be a bowling alley). Once I'm 21 for a while I'll be able to assess the beer and barness of the place, but from the looks of it it's not the best place for meeting nice normal peoples.. just come for some good, moderately priced food and get the beer sampler, that thing looks like fun."
267,5,"I've been in this shop at least once a week against my better judgment. My bank account has taken a beating, but I've been taking away some great finds. Most recently, a Cinzia Rocca wool suit with Bemberg lining, which I'm wearing at the moment. So soft! Other great deals have been brand new Brooks Brothers pants (the tag was still on!) $20, new Adrienne Landau silk scarf, a HUGE and heavy printed Russian wool scarf, etc. I wouldn't go into this store expecting to find specific items, but it's nice to peruse and sometimes you'll walk away with great designer pieces for a fraction of the cost. 

The clothing ranges from new to slightly-worn and the prices can be anywhere from $10 for a skirt to $25 for a sweater to $120 dress to $500 suits to $1000 handbags. It depends on the item. Keep in mind that the shop owner, Enoh, is very reasonable regarding prices. Those of you who are into labels will be able to recognize some great deals. Shoes are also sold, but I'm not a big shoe person so I'm not that hip to the pricing, although I have seen some cute Ferragamo shoes, but sadly not in my size. 

Another important point, the shop is well kept and clean. 

Enoh is very helpful and takes time in finding quality items. He'll keep an eye open for specific items if you write down what you're looking for in his contact book. Jane is a stylist that was recently hired and is a doll. She knows a lot about designer styles, as well as the fashion industry. There's also another really sweet girl whose name I cannot recall. No one is pushy. I really like this store for special finds."
268,5,"A truly fantastic restaurant. Highly unique Southern Indian menu. Of course you can get the standard Indian fare here, but the highlights are to be found in the non-traditional-for-American-Indian-(not-Native-American)-restaurant options. For example, the Avial Malabar, a traditional recipe of Kerala, is a  combination of lots of different vegetables (including drum sticks and green plantains!) in a turmeric/coconut-based sauce, and is highly recommended. It is also one of the few places in the capital region to get Dosa, another Southern Indian feature. Like most Indian restaurants, the a la carte menu is superior to the buffet, but this place shouldn't be missed no matter how you order. Although it's a bit more pricey than other Albany-area Indian restaurants, it's well worth the extra cost."
269,4,"""Cheaper than a McDonald's"" is one way to put it.  I prefer, ""great place to slink into for a late night burger and beer.""  Indeed, this place IS cheap, but what really kills me is the above average beer selection and the  funky-retro formica tables.  The burgers aren't incredible, but I'm not really going to Charlie's for the cuisine.  Great for people watching, and stumbling into after a bar or two."
270,1,"Normally I change my own oil, but sometimes you see a deal that appears to be cheaper than you could do it yourself..

I was with my wife when we brought our Honda in there. It's convenient to drop off you vehicle if you have shopping at the U-Village to do. Jiffy Lube goes through this x-point inspection and tells you a bunch of lies about small services that your vehicle is in need of. They have caught on that most people pass on the expensive fixes, so they make tiny suggestions like, ""we just checked the fluid in the radiator. It's low and needs topped off. It's only $3 for us to do that.""  I passed on that walked over and checked it myself only to find it completely full. They claim there must have been miscommunication. I claim they are liars and scam artists. I give them credit for being artists because they have clearly thought about the price point in creating a scam and realize that 90% of people are going to say ""what the hell, it's $3.""  

I gave them the benefit of the doubt and returned there 6 months later with my truck this time.  Same radiator fluid spiel was given to me. And once again it's full. Okay now I'm certain it's a scam, 

The radiator is just one example of the scams the have. I specifically call attention to this one because it's one that I've busted them on. The also offer you new air filters, windshield wipers and other fluids.

BTW, the wipers the sell don't even last a dozen rainy days. 

Don't waste your time or money.

---------------------
***UPDATE***

I just changed the oil on our Honda (last people to do this was Jiffy Lube).  The oil filter is the one from the previous oil change. They never replaced the filter. It's dated with a Sharpie marker with the date of our prior change.  I doubt this was a forgotten task.  Complete SCAMMERS.  I need to get Jesse!"
271,5,"Always stop by when I am in area! 

It has a variety of flavors and candies to mix in. I am a simple girl and normally opt for chocolate with heath bars. My husband tries different combinations everytime we go and is never disappointed. Its great for families and perfect for a date night when you can grab a cup and walk around and enjoy the area."
272,4,"I love this store, but it's tough to say that there's anything that makes this *the best bookstore ever*! There's nothing particular about it, it's just a great used bookstore that does what a great used bookstore is supposed to do. 

The selection is pretty extensive - I never walk away empty-handed - and the man I see there most of the time, who I assume is the owner, is quiet but friendly. (I mostly wander around in quiet contentment, so I haven't asked for much help.) You can probably find better prices - I'd say average is half the regular price or a little less - but it's all in the wandering experience. The only thing that gets me a little tweaky about the store is there are sooo many piles on the floor that I feel like I'm missing something great in that pile somewhere! But again, sign of a great used bookstore.

Also - bookstore kitty!"
273,3,"This place had a real mystique, built by eccentric employees and unusual twists on ordinary bar food. The names of waitresses or bartenders that had long ago moved on were enshrined on the menu and in the minds of the customers. People could sit around occupying tables for hours without wifi (it hadn't been invented yet.) It carried the old hippie ethic forward almost (or just) into the 21st century.

I can't actually remember when the Del disappeared."
274,3,"My friend and I arrived around 7pm on a Friday.  We were not able to make reservations for the time we wanted so we decided to just try our luck.  We were happy to sit at the bar if there were no tables.  We sat at the bar for about 10 mins before the hostess asked if we wanted to switch to a table.  

I was surprised by the noise level of the place.  It was pretty loud for this type of establishment.   The clientele also seems to be on the older side.  I made a comment to a friend that I felt like I was at a Bertucci.  Maybe it was because of the decor and color of the walls?  

I had the Orient Express with Vodka as a drink.  It was ok.  For an app, we had the charcuterie assortment.  It was decent.  The charcuterie at The Butcher Shop was much better.  I had the Gascon-style duck (seared breast, garlic sausage and confit leg).  It was prepared just right.  For dessert, I had the Pear crostada with caramel almond ice cream.  It was decent also.  

It's a decent place.  I probably wouldn't do it as a date place though."
275,3,"It is what it is...  cheap, fast, greasy.  For me, the coffee and food (egg-white omlette with mushrooms, and hash browns) were not particularly good, but were filling, fast, and only $10.  I was in and out the door in less than 30 mins.  I felt the service was quite good, this morning.

I am at a conference at Columbia, and Tom's is two blocks away.  I will probably be a 7am regular, at least for the next 3 days."
276,4,"Left Cardinale's to have Apparel Design - an alterations and dress making shop run by two very bubbly S.E. Asian ladies - handle all of Rocky's and my tailoring. They are much friendlier, more talented and (for the most part) inexpensive. They are also very accommodating. It's never been an issue for me to get something rushed for same day."
277,2,"Ok I can see how some people can diss this place but its a matter of using your brain.

Yes, the dishes can be a bit saucy, yes some are more of the same flavor. Pick out things that are DIFFERENT. Do get one tofu dish and and then a veggie protein one, make sure the sauces are different, try some delicious curry buns to change it up! And yes, it gets crowded at lunch, duh. Its a really nice place to grab a casual lunch. 


EDITED 7/16/10
I went back a month ago and it was pretty forgettable :\ Everything was DROWNING in sauce. I really wish to God they would use half of the sauce in their dishes. My bf was also convinced that one of our selections had a can of soup as the secret ingredient. Stick to the curry buns I say."
278,5,"What a unique shabby-chic shack nestled behind and in-between other places, so you have to know where you are going if you want to go there. 

This place has legit loose leaf teas and makes boba teas, boba lattes, smoothies, whatever you want. I love it because most boba places only have smoothies and I don't like them thick. 

The wooden-boards place has a door like a fence gate and there is almost as much outdoor-but-enclosed space with lots of cool bench seating as there is inside. People just hang - it can be a good place to study, but I never really found my jive there maybe because it just wasn't as warm/cozy as I wanted. BUT addicted to their teas? YES. Honestly, this is a place unlike what you can find anywhere. It has a very bohemian, all-inclusive sort of vibe. 

For people who have problems with the owners, I would just say it's best to stop being demanding and just think of them like family. At least they aren't fake nice. I think they are real people, actually sweet, and they give good service. Like an older curmudgeon auntie and uncle. I really really love them. This is such a cool place, and it's the darker/edgier but still sweet hipster side of Claremont."
279,1,"Yipe! I've spent the past week chiling out (and will spend three more weeks that way as per doctor's orders) thanks to this class.

The moves in this class (I suspect the ""pretzel"" was a huge contributor) placed enough pressure on my pelvic bone to cause similar damage to CHILDBIRTH. Basically I twisted the cartilage part of the bone so it is inflamed. Now I have to avoid anything that involves putting one leg in front of the other, which is pretty much any form of exercise.

My doctor is really concerned about how my 25 year old childless self managed this. To be fair, I am naturally loose jointed, so it's easier for me to twist myself into bad places. HOWEVER, this class also has a bunch of new mothers, who also have looser pelvic joints, and they are prone to the same problem.

There's little spotting, or instructions about alignment in this class. Please, guys, be really careful, and don't push yourself! Not all pain is good."
280,5,"summary: cheap, filling, awesome, yes i will be coming back for more.

Its very rare to find a place where you want to just eat through the menu.  Today I had a downtown dog (and yes i've had the ones in dtla, the ones that are cooked on a sheet pan over a shady fire apparatus) and this was AMAZING.  

1) its on a charred hawaiian roll.  who knew that toasting the heck out of that hawaiian bread made it amazing.

2) hot dog is HUGE (not like those skinny nathan's hot dogs)

3) Toppings ... there is a full bar of toppings but did not need it.  they dressed up my dog, and my friend's hot dogs in such COLOR and TASTE it was amazing.

4) on the CHEAP.  for under $10 you can really go wild.

5) fries had some skin on it - i like that.

6) ambience - SOOOO hip!  soooo clean!  come sit on a super high wooden box and look cool!  

if you want to compare it to wurstkuche, i would say that this is a less hipster joint, with shorter wait, and more homey.  i can be found eating my way through the menu.  can't wait for an excuse to come back.  although after eating here, it makes me want to get an angiogram.

if you want to compare it to Pinks .... less wait, more places to sit, i feel like the dogs here are more ""put together"" and not just craziness with a cute name.  pinks you're awesome, but ...  ... i'm sorry!"
281,3,"WARNING:  This is a Chinese takeout place in the hood.

That being said, not sure why this place gets negative reviews.  This has been my go-to munchies place for 5 years.  What do you guys expect, the Shangri-La?!?!  This the best Chinese takeout I've had.  When you eat Chinese takeout, you're not looking for a Zagat romantic night out.  This is hungover/pms'ing/munchies type food!!!  

They have deep-fried everything.  A Chinese takeout place uptown is not a Chinese takeout place without some fried chicken wangs!!  If you want greasy comfort food, go for the General Tsao's Chicken Wings (Yup!) and the boneless spare ribs.  Those things are the best no matter what mood you're in.

For all you ""foodies"" this is not the place for you.  You can go to your ""real"" chinese food place, PF Chang's. Hahah!

As for the cockroaches, dirtiness, and the unfriendly loud Chinese people....just google that and you'll see a picture of chinese takeout place in the hood."
282,2,"Not impressed, sausage was cold, service was bad. Asked for muffin as starter as listed on chalkboard, it came with my meal. Omellete was good. Hard to find, sign on front of building is blocked by tree."
283,2,"Based on only one visit, I agree with other Yelpers who say Le Monde has good food but lacks in the service category. I think this explains why it wasn't full at the same time as Community next door had a long line. I enjoyed my food but server was completely inattentive (tip to servers: don't offer something to a guest then forget to bring it.) I even had trouble getting my check!"
284,5,"You know that feeling you get when you fall in love and your so happy on the inside you just want to shout it out!  

That is the feeling I get when I come here, every time I come here...

I don't know if it's the fact that I just came off a diet with my family, or the fact that this place is heaven on earth, maybe both, but what I do know is that this place is brilliant.  I walk in and I am greeted by happy friendly people who love you no matter who you are.  I am allowed to have as many samples as I want and I can have a big slice of amazing cake with some super ice cream for $10.  I know thats a lot for dessert, but you get a lot and its not normal dessert, its screaming how much you love it from the top of a mountain kind of good.  

I love tres leches and this place had a chocolate one thats going to make me want to buy a whole cake for like my wedding or something, with that I had some mint chip something ice cream that was...... I can't think of the words to describe it.  All in all, it would be my dream to own this place and have as much as I want when I want and with whoever I want.... and yes, if I got fat because of the stuff, I DON'T care!  Its sooo goooood!! :)

Go here now and I will join you, I dont care who you are because I love you no matter what...

Can you tell I was just there? :)"
285,5,"Okay, so I haven't tried all the dishes, but I LOVE the veggie plate!!  The BEST falafel I've tried, for sure.  The yummy smell from the sidewalk drew me in!  And the tomatoes and cucumbers in the salad were so fresh and tasty!"
286,5,"We had a tough phone switch scenario last night, and ended up at this store.  Wow.  What a crew!  

The first thing we noticed is their intentional knowledge of their products.  It was like having ""Google search"" on phones in person.  Braavo.

We noticed their staff being very patient with all of our questions, and helpful at the same time.  They were invested in our situation and wanted to find the best outcome for us. Incredible, and not common in 2009.  

We specifically worked with a gal named Caitlyn, who stayed late and worked hard to present all of the best options, and once again showed great patience in the process.  Since we were there late and kept saying we can go, they insisted that we stay there.  The guy was vacuuming at the end of the night, and the manager came and apologized for the extra noise there.  Uhhh...no problem...and I'm shocked that you apologized!  Thank you for being so focused on client relations.

Client relations was clearly the goal of the team last night; they go above and beyond.  Yes, they may be busy when you walk in (referencing the review below), and it is likely because they are working hard for the person in front of them.  Once you realize you aren't the only person on the planet, you can be patient as well...and they will help you."
287,5,"Wow ~ found this place on Yelp when we went to the Staples Center for a show.

I had the Jerk Chicken and it was ""hands down"" the BEST I've ever had. The rice and beans are seasoned perfectly and I could have eaten them as a meal by themselves IF the chicken wasn't amazing... My wife had a fish dish that was great. 

It was so good that we ended up buying a compete dinner (Vegetarian with Jerk seasoning) and a bunch of baked goods to take home to our kids. 

It is definitely worth the drive and we will definitely be back."
288,3,"Was really surprised that there was hardly anyone here on a Friday night!  8:00 pm show, ""Hall Pass"" (didn't like it).  The theater is sort of an icon of Westwood Village, has been here for ages, decades of premieres have been held here.  In the old days, it was really in its glory... but that has passed.

The lobby is beautiful and all the architecture, there are sculptures and movie posters, etc.  But I found the theater stuffy and slightly smelly and the chairs feel reeeeally worn.

Still, it's right in the heart of the Village, near all the restaurants and coffee places (Starbucks next door), so it's convenient, cool crowd, whatever...

No matter how much the theater may have gone downhill, I was with my favorite Yelp friend, Lucy Y. and that's always a treat!!"
289,2,"I wanted to like this place so bad... BBQ pork meat in their sandwiches is so different that what I was used to. Almost stew like.

The smoothies are good.

Sadly i don't think I will be going back."
290,5,"I have gotten my nails done here more times than I can count and I have been a satisfied customer, especially when Vicky does my nails. Vicky is super nice and helps me decide on what colors to choose and tells me about what colors are trending in addition to educating me about nail care. With this post I will upload a picture of my most recent shellec treatment I receive from Vicky.It was actually Vicky's suggestion to try two colors and she was totally right, they look great and it is something I would have never tried had she not suggested it. I really appreciate that Vicky is consistently helpful and thinks outside the box.

Thanks Vicky!"
291,2,"I'm a little frustrated with this place.  Business is booming --- which is great for the cafe but, customer service is sliding here!  Only one cashier ever seems to be on duty during lunch hour and that person is also expected to be a coffee barista as well.  I don't like standing in line with my lunch choice for up to 15 minutes before I even get to pay!  Please hire a barista and let the cashier move people along before their lunches get cold!!"
292,3,"This is not a place I'd choose to go to but when you get out voted sometimes you just gotta suck it up and go with the flow, well this is definitely a happy hour drinking spot as the place was packed so if that's what your into maybe this place is for you. 

As you look over them menu they start you off with chips and salsa, the salsa while a step above your typical Wh-exican restaurant it was still a Wh-exican restaurant salsa, not a good one!.

Like most restaurants the tacos were like $3+ each so I just opted for a burrito and my wife got the caldo de res *(Mexican beef soup), the restaurant is more of a party atmosphere  and not a place to chat with friends while eating, with all the people drinking and Don Vicente pumping through the speakers. 

Caldo de Res - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FBRxoQSWtziiU_A5tscVGA?select=IkYCO28c4P8GIlrY5BUDOw As you can see from the photo this is a Mexican style Beef & Vegetable soup, the caldo *(Broth) is what can make or break a soup and this one was good not great but above average http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FBRxoQSWtziiU_A5tscVGA?select=TUFiQ-8OFp42ea1DPMdDdA the beef and vegetables were all cooked well. 3.5/4-Stars

293,3,"A lot has happen in the last 30 years. We have seen 5 different presidents during this time. The birth of the internet. Cable television.  1979 was a year that held The Pittsburgh Pirates as the World Series Champs, Kramer vs. Kramer swept the Academy Awards, and Green Street Restaurant and it's famous Diane Salad was born. Diane is older than MTV!

There is a lot of history and hype around this Chinese Chicken Salad. Iceberg Lettuce, Poached Chicken, Toasted Almonds, Crispy Noodles, Sesame Seeds, and an Orange Wedge to boot make up this famous salad. The salad's close companion is a sweet, nutty and a butter rich zucchini bread. It is a great match to this salad and is worth a try at least once on a visit to this Pasadena staple. The bark is bigger that it's bite and I could see how people give it an overrated billing. The salad is solid but be prepared for a huge portion. You got to be a fan of Iceberg as the full size serving could easily be a full head of lettuce. Great place for a summer lunch or dinner on the patio but beware of the San Marino housewives at the next table with too much time on their hands. Hey, you might get tips on what tanning salons are open late however. Dinner and show anyone? 

Green Street has a lot more to offer however. There is a good selection of sandwiches on the menu with the Portabello Club and the Stephen's Sandwich toping the charts. They offer a good rotation of specials that range from Duck Sliders to a Shrimp and Black Bean Quesadilla with a Chipolte Sauce. Solid American fare with a budget conscience asking price. Most of the dishes have a touch of spice to them but all work with solid simple ingredients. Sometimes simple is better.

Decor is a little outdated and is a step up from a top notch Marie Calendar's. The patio is the best spot to chow down on a Salad (the menu's strong point) and sip down on one of the 20 specialty cocktails  (full bar is a plus). I have never had to wait more than ten minutes for a table and the service of the food is faster than average. Great spot for a quick cheap bite. 

Service is solid with a young staff that appears to be students working their way through school. One doesn't except 4-star service at a salad and sandwich joint but there is a warm feel of a family owned restaurant. 

Overall this place is rock solid, after all you have to be doing something right to be in business for 30 years. You must consider also that 30 years in the restaurant biz is more like 50. Think that was Eisenhower's term!"
294,5,"Why this doesn't have 5 stars is beyond me. I recently visited Ann Arbor for the weekend and was extremely impressed with what BTB had to offer.

The first stop at BTB was for a mid-afternoon churro after a day of drinking. Late night stop for nachos and more churros. 2 friends and I split the steak nachos and if you watched us eat them, you would probably want to throw up. We demolished them! We literally sat there, faces inches from the plate, shoveling food into our mouths trying to see who could eat the most. It was wonderful. Some boy commented on how he likes girls with appetites until we pulled out churros. Then he was thoroughly disgusted. We were not. We were in a state of sheer drunken food bliss. 

As a UW-Madison student, I was extremely impressed with BTB and very disappointed our campus does not have one."

I ate pizza at Antico, and even though I'm pretty sure the Earth was supposed to shudder on its axis and time was supposed to stand still... none of that happened.  It was pretty good, but the crust was burnt (""crunchy and black"" does not equal ""the perfect char"" to me, sorry).

So anyway, when I say that my pizza from Baby Tommy's was ""pretty good"", you might want to take it with a grain of salt.  I will say this much - I don't think it really tasted (as advertised) like New York Pizza.  I can say this with (relative... okay, kinda shaky) certainty because once back in 1998 I ate at Ray's Pizza in New York.  I have checked out the Yelp reviews of Ray's, and it is apparently good New York pizza.  Baby Tommy's pizza does not taste like that.

It does, however, taste pretty yummy.  And one slice of the stuffed meat pizza should be more than enough for most people to eat for lunch.  It cost only 4 dollars and was literally spilling over with delicious meaty, cheesy goodness.  So while I may doubt this establishment's claims that it is a ""Taste of New York,"" I'd still recommend it."
296,5,"Forty different UT T-shirt designs?  Very nice.
A gazillion burnt orange novelty items?  Wonderful.
Custom Longhorn Lucchese cowboy boots?  Extravagant.
Assorted Bevo soft toys?  Cute.
Free notary public service?  Um.... what?

Yes, after all these years, the Co-op still offers free notary services.  Amazing.  I'm pretty sure it's the only place in the city that does this.  If you have documents that need to be notarized, head on over because you can save some serious bucks.   You don't have to be affiliated with UT to take advantage of this -- it's open to everyone.  Make sure you call ahead though, as the notary is also the head cashier, and not on duty all the time."
297,3,"I liked the Chapli burger, cause it seemed unique, and I love Indian flavors.  I would get it again which is saying something when these trucks offer a lot of competition. Prices were on the high side, but so is much of food truck fare."
298,2,"Pros:
Peaceful atmosphere and clean restaurant. Sitting in the back gives you window seating which is quite nice. Service was friendly and helpful. They also have Turkey Burgers as a substitute which is a plus if you don't eat beef.

Cons:
Food was quite expensive for the quality (burgers and fries) and the drinks were just as pricey. Any non-standard beer was easily over 5$ but most hanging around 7-10$. The food was only average in taste, just met the basic expectations of a burger and fries.

What we ordered:
2 Tigers Burgers (One beef, one turkey) with fries
1 Budlight 
1 Red Wine

Overall:
This is the type of place that you want to walk on past. I would not recommend going out and eating here on purpose. However, if you are forced to eat here, the food is average and the service is good so you will have a pleasant time."
299,5,"I've come to this place quite a few times and its always delicious!!! They also have a decent selection wine which is a plus!

I usually get the combos which are great- the vegetarian one is wonderful and so is the meat. Cool vibe too. I agree w/the previous reviewer about the Tibb Weitt - It is the best in the city! 

ONE THING YELP GOT WRONG IS THEY DO NOT ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS SO YOU MUST BRING CASH!!!!!!! That would have to be the only drawback about this place. Otherwise, its great and I would definitely check it out!"
300,2,"UPDATE, 7/30/08:  I recently received a very nice note from JP himself through Yelp.  He informed me that their ISP has been out to rewire the shop since my review was written.  I have not been back to confirm this, but it's possible that the wifi problems I experienced have been fixed.  In fairness to them, I wanted to update my review with this information.  If I go back and find that the problem has been resolved, I'll be sure and update here again.
---------
I'm currently at Flipnotics, having just left JP Java because I could not get their freaking wi-fi to work, despite trying no less than 1,000,000 times over an hour period with several different programs and asking the poor dude behind the counter to reset their modem twice.  I know it wasn't just me, because several other people in there were having the same problem, and the first time I said something to the counter dude, he said, ""Sometimes you have to just keep trying...the connection is a little spotty.""

This is a deal-breaker for me.  I don't generally go to coffee houses unless I plan to work.  Plus, how am I supposed to procrastinate on Yelp if I don't have wi-fi?  Duh.

Plus, I *specifically* asked the guy before buying my $4 drink whether they had free wi-fi, and he issued no warning whatsoever about their spotty connection.  Grrrr.

So, I camped out for an hour nursing a drink I'd already purchased, grumbling to myself because I couldn't do what I'd come there to do.

If wi-fi isn't important to you, however, this place is pretty cool.  I loved the decor - a great mix of big, comfy, leather chairs and a pretty good amount of table seating, too (with padded chairs - thank you).  If you're using a laptop and need juice, do check for outlets before you choose a spot to sit, as some of the tables don't have outlets nearby.  They also have a nice little patio.  The music is a hair on the loud side for my taste, but again, I was there to work - if you're just visiting or are good at tuning out music, then it might be fine for you.

I did like my iced chai, and liked that they offer thai tea, as well.  You can also ""frappe"" many of their drinks for an additional 60 cents, which means that they add a concoction of sugar and creamer that makes it all frothy and stuff.

Service was friendly and I noticed they carry breakfast tacos from Elsi's and paninis in addition to the usual selection of baked goods - something I always appreciate when I'm camping out somewhere for a while working.

But, like I said, lack of wi-fi is a dealbreaker for me.  Especially when I specifically ask first if they have it.

Fortunately, Flipnotics was right here for me, ready to catch me on the rebound.  I love you, Flipnotics.  I won't ever leave you again."
301,3,"I can't say I'm a regular at this place, but it is very convenient to have a boba place right in the middle of the UCLA campus. This place has a variety of boba (and non-boba drinks) ranging from milk-tea to different kinds of sweet teas to frappuchino-type drinks. They also have shaved ice. I had the crystal green tea boba drink (or a similar name) and it was very tasty! It even had fruit bits in it..yum yum! 
Slightly overpriced and probably not the coziest, cutest place for a boba cafe, but it is a good spot for a pick-me-up."
302,2,"I can hardly imagine a more humorless bar. One bouncer did not take kindly to being compared to Barry White. Another bouncer worked himself into a frenzy when I referred to his gang pals with a pejorative Mexican slang term that means penises. In my defense, I really wasn't expecting to find a ""gang member"" babysitting frat boys in Westwood on a Friday night. Oh and one time a drunk girl left her purse and when I tried to steal it she came back and demanded I return it and and I pretended like I was just keeping it safe for her. 

So... if those stories sounded even remotely interesting, then maybe BrewCo is for you!

I wasn't really going to steal the purse by the way, I was just admiring the craftsmanship."
303,3,"maybe 3 and a half.....   the place was really interesting.  food with flavors I have never really tasted before and was surprised by.  that doesn't necessarily mean good-surprised though.  also if I am paying that much for the meal, my waitress should not be wearing jeans and sneakers and should be somewhat more attentive then lets say the waitstaff of a cheesecake factory.  all in all I enjoyed myself and loved my entree but something about this place left me unsatisfied..."
304,5,"Potenza is the new favorite pizza place to order from for my wife and I. We've tried numerous places over the last year, and Potenza seems to be the most consistent for quality.

My favorite hoagie is chicken parm, as I order one almost every time we call in an order to any pizza shop. I guess you could say that's what I use to compare. I have to say that even if the pizza was awful, I'd at least be calling Potenza to order their chicken parm hoagie! It's that good. Large pieces of breaded chicken, good sauce, and a nice balance of cheese that isn't too overwhelming. Not to mention the large is big enough to feed a few people...or one of me.

Fortunately, the pizza is really good, as well. We've only had cheese, and recently tried the white pizza. Is it the best plain cheese pizza in Pittsburgh? Nope (our nod goes to Fiori's), but you're not going to have any complaints. It's very good for your run-of-the-mill pizza place in town, a la Milano's or Parma, and the white pizza was excellent!

The other great thing has been the delivery. We seem to get a call from every delivery person - regardless of who we order from - asking about where our place is. Potenza's drivers seem to be the nicest ones we've had to deal with.

In short, if you're looking for a pizza joint with consistent quality and service, Potenza is a safe bet...and seriously...best chicken parm hoagie that I've found more recently in Pittsburgh."
305,3,"I had decided to try Casablanca out for Restaurant Week. After reading some of the Yelp reviews here, I considered canceling my reservations, but then decided that I should check it out for myself. We arrived about an hour earlier than our reservation and since there was hardly anyone at the restaurant, we asked if we could be seated and were brought to a table immediately.

We ordered the clams for our appetizer and the steak for our entree. The clams were alongside a creamy sauce and were a good start to our meal. The steak was mediocre and could have been better. For dessert, we ordered each of the two that were available - creme brulee and the caramel lemon chiboust. The creme brulee was delicious and wished I had more. The chiboust was tasty at first but after awhile the lemon just became too tart; if you stick with just a bite or two, it was really good. 

Service was wonderful. The waiter, thinking that I did not like the chiboust, asked if he could get me another dessert as a replacement. That was not needed but definitely a nice gesture. Dinner was good but I was not all that impressed with the food and probably would not come back again."
306,2,"The customer service at this place is poor.  I went there on a Friday night for the first time with some friends that were doing the 100 beer diploma club and they warned that the service was slow.  With this in mind, when we sat down the seven of us ordered 3 beers a piece to start.  I personally had to leave early, but my friends stayed and had about 8 beers each.  When I went to the register to settle my check I was surprised to see my check was for $12 instead of the $6 I expected for the half price deal.  I inquired about this and the person said she put the order into the computer 7 minutes before 9 before the half off deal begins.  I told her first of all that was pretty ridiculous and stingy because it was so close to 9.  I asked her why she thought we would order 3 at a time if we didn't think we were getting a deal.  The waitress said nothing to us about it being still 7 minutes before 9 when she took our order.  I am personally used to the Ram Restaurant and Brewery which I now know is a superior establishment.  When they take our beer orders they do it before 9 and bring us our beers at 9 on the dot and we get the deal on Monday nights.  I thought this was normal quality customer service behavior and expected the same from wing central on the ave.  Talking to the manager about this issue, she wouldn't budge even though they brought us our beers 5 minutes after 9.  6 dollars was not a big deal to me so I didn't make a fuss, but on a principle level I was very angry.  The manager said it was too hard to change the orders in the computer.  

These people don't know what customer service is.  Seven guys that brought more people to the restaurant and ordered over 50 beers in a night and were repeat customers because of the beer diploma promotion were treated as if they were worthless to wing central.  If you expect quality customer service and fair treatment DON""T GO TO WING CENTRAL."
307,2,"First, service is fast. Before you can pocket your change, your food is packaged and ready. My lamb kabob plate was good; I would give it a 3 or 4 if that was the end of it. But my friend's chicken was dry and there was a bug in her salad."
308,3,"Ordered: Pho Tai, Che Ba Mau (Three-bean drink)

The interior of this place is obviously trying to lure people from La Jolla with modern clean lines and lighting which have nothing to do with vietnamese style but maybe that's a plus for some people. The musky yellow walls with black fixtures and black spoons complemented each other nicely, giving the place a darker feel to it which was offset by the sun coming in. There is even a small flat-screen tv playing but you wouldn't be able to read the subs on a screen so small let alone hear it over the radio playing on the store's speakers. The place seemed very small however with chairs and tables placed close to one another, i'd hate to see what it's like at capacity but thankfully it was relatively empty when my roommate and I went.

The place where this restaurant is strong is definitely the service. Staff is friendly and fast, almost seems like they're over-staffed to me (they had a chef, 2 waiters, someone on register, and a bus-er) but hey not gonna complain about people waiting to do stuff for me. Food was on the table and in my mouth in what seemed like 5 minutes.

Like most people have said however, the food is only decent. I had the golden standard - pho, and I was underwhelmed, having been spoiled on pho in convoy and mira mesa. The portion was fine with a fairly standard amount of noodles (which were cooked just right), veges and meat, but the problem was the broth. Pho restaurants are made or broken by the broth (as well as fish sauce), it's the key component to their signature dish! The broth seemed very weak and transparent to me, lacking the character, depth and savory oomph of broth from other places. The three-bean drink also seemed very transparent and light which isn't necessarily bad but it could've done with a little more flavor. They used split mung beans which was nice as it provided a nice texture along with the red beans but it needed slightly more sugar as these beans by themselves aren't sweet enough to be called a dessert. Since the mung beans weren't mashed, the drink seemed to lack substance once the coconut milk was added (which was thin as well). They also use green jelly cubes instead of the usual green chewy tapioca strings, which makes it even lighter. The overall effect was a light and bean-y drink when I was expecting a viscous chewy sweet dessert drink.

With my Pho, dessert drink, and my roommate's Vermicelli bowl it all came out under $20 which is decent, at least they're not gouging you for the convenience or mediocre fare they offer.

Overall I give this place three stars because it's alright, it's not really amazing or really disgusting. As a convenient pho restaurant for UCSD kids, it's decent. I'd gladly drive the 15 mins to grab pho in mira mesa or convoy but not everyone has that luxury. Not a place to go out of your way for. Some people may prefer the lighter and more transparent flavors of this place but I can't help but feel that they're just watering everything down or aren't taking the time to stew their bones long enough to extract maximal flavor for their broth. If you're like me and are used to the strong savory flavors and soul-food-satisfaction vietnamese soup brings, I'd probably check somewhere else out like Pho Hoacali."
309,2,"This place screwed up our reservations and were refusing to  seat us even though there was 4 empty tables and no one else was coming in until 7. (it was 5:15) I feel the hostess miss treated us because we looked young. the same feeling I got last time we ate here. First she said she couldn't find us on the list, then the bartender did and asked her to just seat us now and she was really rude about it. Needless to say we will not be returning here."
310,5,"OMG - I came down to NYC for a mini vacation and was taken here by a friend who lives in the area.  She recommended the almond croissants, and so we walked over to pick them up around 10AM on a Friday morning.  There was a long wait, and we had to ask for them b/c they were being kept in the kitchen for some unknown reason, not displayed with the other pastries.  The almond croissants are off the hook!!! (I think that's the first time I used that saying ever.)   I'm thinking that it's going to be a light, fluffy, tasty, but not filling breakfast and decide to eat a hard boil egg beforehand.  Boy was I wrong.  There was a reason why the to go bag weighed like 10 pounds.  These were the densest croissants I've ever had, filled with some kind of sweet custard like filling and the pastry dough itself had a lot of depth and texture to it...just amazing.  Also, i didn't need sugar in my coffee as the sweetness of the croissant was enough for my tastebuds.  I felt like I was in Paris for about 30 minutes.  It reminded me of the chocolate croissant that I had at the Eiffel Tower a few years back.  I would certainly come down from Boston to get these again."
311,5,"I wish San Francisco had a place like Gypsy's! A friend brought me here after rock climbing, swearing that the combination of price and quality was unbeatable. We both had Gypsy's Chicken by his recommendation. Penne, cream sauce, mushroom, garlic and chicken. Amazing! The garlic bread was awesome, too - actual roasted garlic on bread. 

I'll be coming back to Gypsy's anytime I'm in Berkeley!"
312,2,"Ordered take out from here. The pizza was mediocre. I ordered online, and also ordered a 2 liter Coke. When the delivery guy came, he said he forgot it but would come back and bring it. An hour passed, and I called to ask what was going on, and if I could just get a refund. Not unless I did it through the site I ordered through, and since that seemed unlikely, I asked him to in fact just send the Coke. The delivery guy finally came with the wrong drink, in a can. So much hassle, and not worth it."
313,3,"The owners are friendly, but their menu/food is nothing to write home about. Definitely mediocre. Very affordable though."
314,5,"As an 01 UMass Amherst alumna, the trip back to Amherst and Pasta E Basta this past weekend was looong overdue.  And boy did this visit to Pasta E Basta make me feel complete.  I forgot how f-ing amazing this place is.   After having some leftovers of a friend's Penne Alla Vodka something-or-other with Chicken and Broccoli, I had to order my own... OMG, it was to die for! And the complimentary bread is so damn delicious too! And after thinking about it, this could be one of the reasons why I was 30 lbs heavier in college... hmmm..."
315,1,"Ok Cockroaches YUCK!!! Called the health department a couple times and no one has done anything. That whole block has cockroaches including the smoke shop (Sams), the only place that does not seem to have a problem on that block is chipotle"
316,5,"Imagine someone pouring melted, high quality, dark chocolate down your mouth...that's exactly how their Dark Chocolate Sorbet tastes! The Vanilla Bourbon is to die for! The flavors are endless at this place and unimaginable. 
The price is not cheap but for the quality of ice cream you get, it's definitely worth it. Have I mentioned the cupcakes??? OMG! Grab a scoop & get yourself a mini cupcake to go with it. 
Not sure about the flavors? Just ask for a sample. This is a great place for date nights! ENJOY"
317,3,"I hated this place when I first tried it, I got the Guacamole Burger with the thin-cut fries. I expected a lot more from it because all my friends raved about this place. But all in all, it was tasteless and unappetizing. My friends dragged me here again, and I tried the spicy mac n cheese, nachos, and THEIR CHOCOLATE FUDGE BROWNIE SUNDAE!!! ahh at first I thought it tasted kinda strange (the sundae) and then I was in heaven by the end :D AND their nachos are surprisingly deliciousss! However their Mac n Cheese disappointed again. If I come here again, I'm definitely coming back for the nachos and the sundae. 
Overall, its fairly priced and a fun, casual place to hang out with friends. It's not on my MUST GO BACK list but I wouldn't mind coming back."
318,1,"Hosted an event this week for three days and pre-ordered the pizza from this place the week prior for about 30ish students each day.... so about $600 of business for them, from us, this week.  Most of my team manages these events from the West coast, so we try to be diligent about planning ahead.

Pros: Pizza was good. 

Cons: they were late every day...by btwn 30 - 45 minutes.  When the guy did show, there were an average of 4 - 6 pizzas that were inedible because the box had been lugged sideways instead of flat.  First day, I called about the 5 pizzas we couldn't eat, they sent some replacements while a group of hungry students waited an extra hour for lunch.... second day, they again brought late and crumpled pizza despite calling to verify the delivery time.  Third day, called in the AM to make sure we were good to go... guy showed up 45 mins late.  When I called the manager, he told me he was sorry and that he would fire the driver... seems like not only a bad business, but a horrible place to work.  

Get your pizza from someplace else!!"
319,3,"It's been a couple weeks since I went to Ten Ren's Tea Time for the first time.  I got some friend dumplings and some sort of soup.  Chicken? Beef?  I can't remember now, but does it matter. Yes - the meal was THAT memorable ;P Everything I tasted was bland and, save for the great company and conversation I had with a friend of mine while eating, the entire experience was quite forgettable.  I do remembering adding a bunch of sauce to give the dumplings some kick (not that it helped much). The Edamame was solid, but nothing special. 
Honestly, it was really disappointing for me. I love East Asian food - Chinese, Japanese, Korean - I take the opportunity to try many different restaurants.  That being said, there are a ton of places out there now to choose from and I really feel that some are just skating by on their past laurels or not even trying at all anymore.  Ten Ren's falls somewhere in the middle for me.  I am rounding this review up to a three because the food wasn't completely horrible, it was just uninspired.  I am telling you now though: it really is more like a 2.5... tops. Doubt I will be back."
320,1,"Well, this is a bit tricky. Enrolled my daughter in their after school tennis camp and was horrified by the behavior of the Junior Tennis Director.  She was outright rude and abusive towards the children and took any opportunity to embarrass them in front of the class.   At first I thought my daughter was exaggerating, but to my horror, she minimized her behavior.  When I tried to call the Director repeatedly, he never returned my call, which I hear is typical there.  When the children would show up near the first day of the month she would yell about who hadn't paid. She told them to get on the phone with their parents and make sure they were paid for before they could play that day...embarrassing and awkward for the kids, especially since it wasn't even the first of the month!  Needless to say, after not getting a response from the Director, we left Caswell.  Really unfortunate because of the convenience-great for court availability though."
321,2,"I was there for a cut. Nothing fancy, no special challenges. Just a simple day-to-day cut. I even brought a picture of exactly what I wanted. 

The parking situation was a bit frustrating: No parking lot, only sparse street parking. Nevertheless, I went in with high hopes and Lisa was the stylist (the eldest of the three).

Yes, it's true, they don't have a receptionist, so sometimes they do run to get the phone or to collect service fee from clients. The three siblings seemed very nice, though Bonnie seemed the quiet type while Chuck was chatting up his client the whole time (Chuck is the middle one, and Bonnie the youngest).

While Lisa was very friendly, I really am not impressed with the cut I've received. I realize now you get what you pay for. And now I've got to find someone to fix this mess that's sitting on my head..."
322,3,"I always walk by this cafe and go straight to Moccacino, two days ago, i decided to try their Woofles. Woofles are basically healthy, made from scratch, pretty waffles. I ordered a Deluxe Woofle, and it was kind of blend, and she didn't give me enough whip cream, and i could barely taste the chocolate flavor. But definately better than your everyday waffles. 

The layout of the place can be 4 star though, because it has an upstairs and downstairs is just a quiet cafe setting, but the food are not as satisfying."
323,3,"4 stars for the service and 3 stars for the drinks. 


Finals week and my friend and I were stressed. We needed a study break bad. We headed down to Westwood to get some boba for a little caffeine kick and some fresh air. After finally finding parking, we walked over only to see the server closing up shop. 
""We're closed."" He said to us. 
""OH NO! We just wanted some boba..."" I said. 
""What did you guys want? Milk tea?"" He looked very apologetic. ""Hold on a second.""
5 minutes later, he came out with a milk tea for each of us, on the house! That made our night and studying a little more bearable. We are forever grateful to you. 

As for the drinks, in general they're your average boba drinks. I haven't had a bad drink, but they're nothing special. Good enough to satisfy boba cravings at 12am."
324,1,"It took 45 minutes to serve our breakfast, and there were few other people waiting.  My french toast was good, although the serving was a bit small.  But the kicker was that my side of breakfast sausage consisted of two HOT DOGS!!!!!  We asked the server if they were, in fact, hot dogs (there was no question about this based on appearance or taste) and he said that no, they were the breakfast sausage.  They didn't even take them off the bill.  

I wanted to like this place, but we just ran out of there in horror."
325,3,"This place needs to make a clean break from Club Passim.

I loved going here as a college student, and still think about their vegan desserts, their brunch, the ""dinner for Henry"", from the other side of the country. And maybe they don't do this anymore, and I know Club Passim is a ""big deal"", but nothing is more annoying than being asked to be silent during dinner for some vanilla folk singer. Work out a new system. Ugh Boston."
326,2,I was trying to be nice and polite when I came in here but I found a bit of info and when I said I was there to find a bird cus my hubby wanted one.....she was like angry and said to me well tell ur husband to come and then we will talk!! What the heck I was being nice is it cus I am latina or cus im a woman??? She was very nice with him after and they didn't believe me. I have met several of this women they are men lovers woman haters......or maybe was me?  But I was very smiley and polite? O well
327,1,"This place just wasn't very good. 

I came here hoping for a quick delicious sushi lunch. Unfortunately I got neither! Although this place is called sushi king it is primarily a Chinese restaurant. When I got there at around 11:45 there was no sushi chef so I was stuck ordering off the Chinese menu. 

I ordered the beef in garlic sauce (it promised to be spicy) with pork fried rice and won ton soup. The won ton soup was okay and while the beef wasn't bad it was by no means good (and not spicy!). The fried rice was the only saving point of this meal.

It was cheap atleast, I believe $6 for my meal and a can of coca-cola classic. I would just avoid this place altogether though."
328,3,"Let's start off with the service...it's not the best and it's not the worst. but at least put a freakin' smile on your face! the vibe that the cashier was throwin' out was soooo negative. she didn't even smile once. not to me or the next customer in line. it was kinda pissin' me off but hey, what can i do right? the lemon pepper @ wingstop is great. the original hot and atomic are good too. but i wasn't really much of a fan of the garlic parmesan. I to-go'ed it and it seriously SERIOUSLY smelled like they crapped in the boxes. stunk up the entire car. 

And the only reason why i'm giving this place a 3 star is because i like the chicken and not their unwelcome faces.."
329,2,"Strange - it looked nice in the lobby, but the carpet in the room we had had huge stains and was filthy.  Hard to comprehend how they would rent this room out like this.  Plus, they did not deliver the rollaway bed or crib when we asked, and the crib was broken :)  Not what we have started to expect from Hampton Inns."
330,3,"NOT worth the money.
how come everyone else's experience was so off the chart ?? My experience was very disappointing, maybe my expectations are too high after dining at Le Cordon Bleu's five-sixty-one, I guess I was expecting this to be the graduated version of it -- but it wasn't ]:
the server was not friendly, nor professional to me and my bf (we were well-dressed, mind you)... but he seemed to gave great service to the table next to us. that's not right. they need to train their servers to not SHOW their prejudice. the service ruined the whole experience.
 
First of all, I believe they have different dining areas but we were stuck inside this small room with low ceiling (it felt like ?) with nothing to look at but other tables.. decor wasn't all that.. i wouldn't take a date here. 
then, I was debating over the riesling or the burgundy and he told me to get the riesling.. when he let me taste the riesling, I made it obvious that I didn't really like it -- and he gave me this look like ""so you want it or not ?"" ...didn't bother to say anything else to me, so I was stuck with a bottle of unfavourable riesling. 
FOOD, was OKAY... the baked brie was nice -- it was in phyllo
then I had the vegetarian special... I can't really recall but it was something in phyllo also, served with spinach, string beans and potatoes. it tasted like it involved very little culinary skills. (if it was a good restaurant they should still be able to create a tasteful vegetarian dish).
boyfriend had the duck and he said it was good.
desserts were good - i wouldn't recommand the souffle, it's called chocolate soup because it's literally like just chocolate sauce. (whereas the souffle @ fleur de lys was just perfect, and 561 wasn't bad [: ) 
but i DO recommand the lemon berry tower with the blueberry ice cream profiterole. 
by the way lemon berry tower was ALSO in phyllo... they gave me phyllo for all 3 course... i wonder if the server realized it..
if you eat meat, you'll like it i assume.
but this place is just NOT worth the money !!"

332,3,"It's a shame that I still go to starbucks even though I work at a coffee shop that sells the best coffee in the DC metro area. I mean, if Murky wasn't so far away, I'd go there to get my coffee fix. Unfortunately, I have to come up with a backup plan... 

Starbucks. Yikes. 

So yeah, their espresso is burnt. Their coffee tastes burnt. But they have a DAMN GOOD gingerbread latte. For real. The staff at this store is pretty cool. I like the morning folk and some of the evening peeps. The midday shift people are okay, I guess. 

FINALLY - they're starting to catch onto the fact that I only want my grande travel mug filled HALFWAY. I've had this travel mug for over a month and EVERY TIME I ORDER A DRINK I've asked for it only half-filled, but they fill it up. Why? I don't know, but it was irritating. At least they know, finally."
333,2,Ordered Vegetarian Pad Thai and Thai Ice tea. The pad thai was so bad (despite me ordering like a spice level 8). No flavor.. not enough salt. It wasn't so good. In fact I still have half of it left in my plate as I write this review and I am going to have to toss it. Rather not eat Veggie Pad Thai ever here
334,1,"Poor service, poor food, poor decor, and expensive. I think it stays open because guests at the next-door hotel come here without knowing any better."
335,3,"Service was great - friendly hostess, nice and competent server.  Lotsa unasked for refills for our rootbeers

Ambiance was great - hip decor with varying seating arrangements (bar, regular and communal tables) - plus: neat bathroom setup, minus: the space was a little noisy

Food was so-so - three of our dishes were overspiced (eggplant tiger bowl, barley corn side, BBQ chicken bowl) enough that we didn't finish them. Surprisingly, the tofu-lentil loaf was the best of the bunch.  The death by chocolate dessert was really just like a slice of fudge.  Portion size was good and the prices weren't overblown.

Calafia is good and a nice addition to PA.  I wouldn't jump at going back, but I wouldn't dissuade fellow-Yelpers from going there."
336,3,"After many months of anticipation, my regular lunch-gang was pleased to see this new addition in the 30th Street Train Station Food Court.  We thought it would be nice to have something a little different that the standards (Subway, McDonald's, Taco Bell, Cosi, Au Bon Pain, KFC, etc.).

I tried the 'True Blue' entree crepe, a savory mix of chicken breast, blue cheese crumbles, walnuts, tomato, baby spinach and honey mustard dressing, all contained in a cone-like crepe.  Not too bad.  I do have a few misgivings, though:

1.  The box that my dine-in crepe was served in is enormous.  Like a box you might get at Macy's when you want to gift-wrap a shirt or something.  Has the Crepemaker not heard of environmentalism?  I feel really bad about the poor trees being killed to transport my crepe 30 steps away to a table.

2.  There was not a whole lot of chicken in my crepe.  I watched the prepper make the crepe, and I saw the pre-measured amount of chicken pieces added...it was maybe two ounces total, if that.  For a crepe costing $7.25, maybe a bit more chicken would be nice.

3.  My crepe was a little on the crispy side.  It was cooked about 30 seconds too long.

I split a dessert crepe with two other people, and other than the fact that my friend Bob was being a little bitch about having to go stand in line and order the crepe, it was okay.  We got the ""Triple Treat"" (I wanted him to order the Nutty Caramel Apple, but like I said, he's a little bitch) and it was kind of boring.  It had bananas, nutella and strawberries, but was missing the advertised whipped cream.

I'll probably give the CrepeMaker another shot, but I might wait a little bit to give them time to work out their kinks from being the new place in the Train Station."
337,3,Solid burger joint for those looking for something other than cheddar or Swiss cheese on your patty.
338,3,"We've been coming here for years, my husband and his family love it. I on the other hand think it can do better for there food. The drinks are great especially how they offer their Happy hour bad thing the location is near usc and a lot of university kids come and it's always crowded and when its like this you cant even sit in peace because you are been rushed out unless they know who you are. But other than that its OK."
339,2,"So I'm scared of the dentist - everybody has their thing, don't judge. Because of my insane discomfort regarding teeth, sharp objects, and pointy things in my mouth, (along with a lack of dental insurance) it had been a few years. This office is located just across the street from where I work so it's convenient - and that's pretty much why I've chosen it.

I've gone in for three appointments during the last year and a half. A couple of cleanings plus one preemptive filling. While the facility is ok - the receptionists can be kind of cool (the hygenists are very sweet) and I find that I'm often left in ""the chair"" just waiting for something to happen.

Plus the cleanings are kind of brutal - there's always a lot of blood and pain involved for yours truly - which, when I'm returning to work makes for a less than awesome afternoon.

My particular doctor is ""ok"" enough but she has this wierd obsession/desire to pull my wisdom teeth - a needless and painful procedure not covered by my insurance? mmm, no thanks. She's brought it up and been sort of pushy about it at each visit - I've seen two oral surgeons over the course of my lifetime who've both assured me that the extra teeth can stay - so the fascination kind of freaks me out (not to mention that I'm already on high alert just being in a dentist's office).

For now they'll do, but I'm in the market for another dentist - I just feel way too uncomfortable here."
340,3,"Bread Company has a selection of great ingredients that results in good food, but the service is terribly inconsistent. I have a bunch of stories about this, but here's the two that contrast most significantly: (1) When I came for afternoon drinks with my writing group, it was quiet and we received great, not-too-hands-on service: a nice mixture of noticing when we might want more drinks and letting us alone.

(2) A few weeks ago, my husband and I went with a party of 6 for dinner 1 1/2 hours before a show, told them our schedule, and were assured that we should have plenty of time. Cool -- except that the whole thing turned out to be kind of a disaster. We all ordered at the same time, and there seemed to be plenty of servers for a full room at dinner, but our meals arrived over the course of a half-hour (the pasta came after the steak, hmm). Fresh and tasty dinners, yes, but it was impossible to wait and eat together, and everyone was antsy due to the delays. In the end, we finished 20 minutes after our preferred time and our waitress did not seem particularly motivated to help the situation along or even really apologize.

So: Good food, decent wine, but the service is a gamble. Try it, but go on a quiet weeknight -- definitely not for a Krannert opening or right before another occasion."
341,2,"Good selection, not even close to Sams and more expensive. 

If venturing over to durham for better price and selection is too much for you then its ok."
342,2,latte tasted like water. coffee tastes burnt. is it possible to sell worse tasting caffeinated drinks? only at roadside truck stops do you get coffee as awful as starbucks. if only they would burn their coffee a little less...if only....for those of us that judge a cup of coffee by its taste with no cream or sugar.
343,3,"I'll get straight to the point: the veggie-q sandwich. I'm always a fan of coleslaw on a sandwich and the coleslaw was delicious. The bread was good, the tofu was good, the chips and drink were good. The service was also great - the staff super friendly. The only thing I would really change was the BBQ sauce, it just wasn't my favorite. Otherwise, it would have been a great sandwich and a perfect lunchtime experience."
344,3,"Not the greatest pizza I've ever had, but they give you a huge slice and a soda for really cheap.  I wasn't happy when they raised the price to $2.99, but that just makes for less change I have to carry around the rest of the day.  Happy hour is fun too, especially when you split a pitcher right before lab, going to class buzzed is always fun."
345,1,"Happened about a year ago and was never given justice for my case with what happened here at the Mid East Club, so i thought id write my review which i never had the opportunity to do before.

First two times attending Mid East, and everything was fine. The third night going here I ran into a different lady checking IDs at the desk inside, and she was very rude claiming driving licenses were not accepted as ID. I said fair enough, and politely left the venue. 

I came back for another event on a different night, this time with my passport, but turns out the same lady who rejected my ID the last time at the front desk is a racist with a chip on her shoulder and decided to take it out on me.

 She told the cop standing inside to give me a sobriety check after checking my passport and asking me ""ARE YOU FEELING OK?"" with her extremely rude and condescending tone when i was being very polite, cooperative and was 100% sober.   

The cop inside gave me a 'sobriety check' by flashing his flash light into each of my eyes..... he then asks me ""WHY YOU SMILING AT ME LIKE UR CUTE?"" from here i knew this lady behind the desk and the cop were trying to provoke a reaction, so i said ""What do you mean why am i smiling at you?"" in a normal manner. The lady behind the desk then signalled the cop and out of nowhere 5 other cops ran into the venue and jumped me, beat me up on HER signal inside the bar.......all i was doing was standing there waiting silently while he flashed his flash light into my eyes .....and even if i was smiling, which i wasnt, it isnt against the law.  

Spent the night in a cell after they beat me up, slamming my head into a wall, punched in the jaw, and left bruises all over me (one in the shape of a handprint on my arm from how hard one of the cops was grabbing me) robbed my $40 from my pocket, stripped my clothes off in my cell down to my t shirt and jeans (which is normal procedure i think) but then left the back door open next to my cell with bostons blizzarding weather so i would be freezing cold.

Im diabetic and they denied me my insulin as i shouted from my cell for my meds (no one came to my aid - even before i went in i told the cop i needed to take my insulin), placed next to a psycho who apparently wanted to kill me and fuck my mother. The phone inside the cell was busted so i couldnt call anyone and was told by the cop ""Well i guess you better hope someone finds ya!"". Luckily my brother who was with me that night spent a long time trying to find where i was after they practically kidnapped me in their pitch black van in handcuffs, without telling him where i was going. He was able to bail me out after I was in the cell for 4 hours.

I had to go to court the same morning of release. The cops told me to be at Cambridge Courthouse ""8am SHARP! DONT MISS IT.""... turns out the court building opened at 9.30am when i arrived there, so had to wait in the freezing cold for an hour and a half for the doors to open. The judge gave me 20 hours community service for apparently ""trespassing"" and ""disorderly conduct"" - these charges were made up. 

Someone elses district attorney ran up to me as i tried to defend myself to the judge explaining how i did nothing wrong, he whispered in my ear ""Just accept what shes giving you, it could be a lot worse.""

So lastly, some personal words......FUCK the mid east club, and that bitch behind the counter, she knows who she is if she reads this. Clearly someone was having a very bad day. Dont go here."
346,1,"Everyone talks about Zingerman's like it's the best food they've ever eaten, but I disagrree. Agree completely with Carl---this place is way overrated and also too expensive. I'm not sure how so many people think it's that good."
347,3,"This place is okay. The food is okay. Atmosphere is okay. They have nice waitresses/waitors, though. And happy hour is always good for $5 appetizers. My boyfriend and I come here only when we have coupons- buy one entree, get the second half off (or free); 3-course meal for $30 (for two... which is really good b/c you can order ANYTHING on the menu, and the breadstick is DELICIOUS!). I hear that there are $0.01 appetizers if you buy a drink at the bar.

But their alcohol SUCKS. their most popular drink was bleh (I don't even remember what it was called. It was something fruity with pear in it). The next time i went, i was hoping for something better, and ordered a mojito. it was disgusting, but my bf had to chug it down because it was $7 and he didn't want to waste it. I told him that the next time we come, his job is to restrain me from ordering any alcohol. I guess we'll see how that goes."
348,3,"This place would definitely be more interesting if I ate meat. That aside, the tuna sandwich was good, not too mayo-ey thank god, and it had relish in it yummm. For my sandwich and chips it was $10 and I know it's not subway, but I do feel it was a bit much.

I will say they have many cheesesteak options so if you're into those you should come here, although I can't say how good they are. 

If I return I will try their special veggie sandwich, it sounded avocado based and good."
349,3,"I officially hate Thai food.  It makes me so bloated the next day that I just can't stand it, and now, unfortunately Berkeley Thai House has to take the brunt of this hatred.  I ate there last night, I was disappointed by the lack of variation between all the seafood dishes - almost all were shrimp with vegetable and some different sauce."
350,2,"On one of those ""who knows what I'll have for lunch today"", I searched the web for something new.  And I wound up here. 

For a half chicken (half today, the remaining for tomorrow) with two sides (rice & beans and cole slaw) and two pupusas $ 11.  Not starting off well.  
On my way back to work, I tried the pupusas.  I know, distracted driving, but I was so excited!  Oh, the salsa and the cabbage was delightful, but the actual pupusa; I wished I could have returned it.  The cheese and the masa was flavorless... so disappointing.  
Then there was the cole slaw, which was mostly mayo, not lots of veggies.  The chicken was just heavily seasoned, not Peruvian-style.   The rice and beans were OK.

Not going back."
351,1,"Went here Friday night with a friend, and found it to be a terrible experience. The portions were tiny, and none of the food looked fresh. The meat tasted so old, I felt sick from eating it. Service was equally awful; there weren't many people in the restaurant yet the food came slowly and our waitress never checked up on us. 

Even with a groupon, it was not worth it. I would definitely recommend going to one of the shabu places in chinatown instead."
352,3,"This place is very similar to bubble tea joints in norcal... nothing special. Pre-made milk tea in large vats where they scoop spoonfuls into your plastic cup. 

The place had a lot of space, though and several outlets running under their chairs. Seemed like a study place for a lot of the PCC kids."
353,3,"If reviews were based on food alone, I would give Bobby's a solid 4-star.  The crafted burgers are delicious even if they aren't as carefully put together as the pictures.  I like my meat medium-rare, but I always order medium after the first time I ordered medium-rare - the burger was literally seared on each side for 10 seconds and my first bite made the patty crumble into raw strands of ground beef, pretty gross as I am not a fan of low quality raw meats.  I gave it another shot, and the next couple of times I went were pretty good and I often crave Bobby's burgers.  

The reason for the 3-star is the service.  So incredibly slow, sometimes taking 30 minutes even when there are only 3 people ahead of me.  Even when I order take-out, my order isn't ready for 30 minutes and the staff is often times clueless as to where my order went.  Sometimes they are nice, more often times they are rude and unhelpful.  After the weeks following opening day, the service took a dive and hasn't been getting any better.  Sad considering I love their burgers, fries, and milkshakes."
354,3,"Granted it was a busy night but we had no waiter/waitress come up to us for almost 10 minutes. It turned out the host that brought us to the table became our waitress?? Anyway, I don't expect great service in Asian restaurants anymore. 

Used my groupon and it was worth it. Ended up paying $21 (including tip) for two shabu dishes and a roll of spicy tuna. Love the bargain. 

Food itself was okay. I brought my sister along and both of us agreed that the kimchee broth was kind of bland. Not enough spice or flavor...especially compared to the last time I went. Perhaps because it was a busy night? Even so, there's no consistency of the flavor. Everything else was good. Good meat and veggies. Just wish the broth was more spicier and more flavorful. 

Overall, I would probably choose one or two other shabu places over this place. If you want a good experience here, I would go on a night that's not busy...and make sure you're rich because this place isn't cheap."
355,1,"I have been to this Office Depot twice in two weeks and I don't care if I have a life threatening emergency and need to buy an emergency legal pad or pen, I will never, ever go to this store again!  On my first visit one evening.  There was one cashier, who apparently was the manager on duty and one person in training and about 25 pissed off people in line.  The manager was trying to ring people up and the man in training was clearly having a nervous breakdown and did not know what he was doing, which caused the manager to need to help him every few seconds.  I was in line FOREVER!  My next visit.  Again, one cashier, and about 10 people in line.  They finally get a second cashier and when it was my turn I did my return and was about to leave when I realized there was an error on my receipt.  I go back and the cashier was very nice, he called a manager to fix the problem.  He called again, no manager, and again, no manager, he then asked someone else, but was told he needed a manager.  This guy bent over backward to try to get the problem resolved and seemed just as frustrated that no one could clear up the problem quickly.  Finally a manager appears and disappears then is walking around with my receipt talking to an employee!  They really need to get a clue here and hire WAY more staff and train them properly.  You shouldn't need a manager to do a $11 return!  I never thought I loved Staples, but I do now!!"
356,3,"I came here for Sunday brunch with a friend and we sat outside.  The California eggs benedict (with avocado) was tasty, and the service was pretty good, with frequent coffee refills.  On the down side, some of the breakfast potatoes weren't quite cooked through, and I realized only later that my meal was supposed to come with a tasty-sounding buttermilk biscuit but didn't.
The best thing about the place, though, was that unlike many other places nearby, there was no long wait for a table.  This meant we could get right to our brunching, which on a Sunday morning, is often the most important consideration."
357,2,"It's hard to review a place that focuses all their energy on soup, but I checked it out today and was not really that impressed.  

First, its astronomically over-priced.  Soup should be cheap.  When a restaurant cleans out their cooler and finds an abundance of extra peas, that's the soup of the day.  If the soup were less expensive, it would be worth going back.

Second, I hate the name.

Third, their split pea was alright and their chicken tortilla soup was good.  The bread was bread.  I think you could order a sandwich and a salad and all that sort of stuff, but a soup and sandwich combo isn't always necessary. 

But how the hell did I spend $10 on two bowls of soup?  That's not reasonable.  This place is not reasonable.

I guess if you're sick, and have money to burn, you should check this place out.  Otherwise, stick with authentic local spots that do soup on the side-- not a place that hypes up the soup."
358,3,"Wide selection of teas and I liked the different options you get when ordering (pot, personal pot, cup, etc.).  The royal coconut pouchong was smooth and soothing, great to sip on while I got some work done there.  Wouldn't mind coming by again to try some of the other teas or some boba."
359,3,"Lacking other options, we headed over to Awful Arthurs for dinner before a work event at Vtech. I didn't think the food was awful at all. The service was not so great though. I ordered a combo platter w/scallops and crab cake and a side salad w/veggie. All were fine; not fantastic but fine. My peers enjoyed their salads. 

The ambience is soreing lacking. But, if you want seafood; go. Also, they have a big bar and pool table area and a large area for private parties upstairs. Oh yeah and some outdoor seating."
360,1,"This place! I can't believe how anybody can run a business like this! After seeing all the reviews i really wanted to try this place. So, i try calling SEVERAL TIMES for a FEW DAYS....no one pick up the phone! So i gave up and try going somewhere else. Can't believe anyone run a business like this~"
361,2,"This is definitely the spot for Penn gear, not that I ever buy any, & for housewares, not that I buy them from here....  If you're a student with someone else's credit card and without a ride to Ikea/Target, you can furnish your room with the bookstore's wares.  It's a rather large property complete with a bookstore and some cozy reading nooks on the 2nd floor if you're lucky enough to grab one.  No, the prices here aren't better than those at online retailers, but I don't think any physical bookstore can beat the online options on price.  When you come to a university bookstore, you know what you're in for - the textbooks, the college gear, & stationary minus bargain basement pricing."
362,3,"Great location!

Aside from this is just your average-run-o-tha-mill bike shop. Average selection, Average prices... even the employees are  moody in the average  bike shop sort of way."
363,3,"I had great expectations for this place. But then, when I finally got there, I had a pizza and it was pretty bland and boring. The ambience is pretty spectacular though. If only the food was better."
364,3,"I really like Crate & Barrel, but I am not such a big fan of this location. As others have said it is arranged rather oddly on several levels that are connected by wide staircases. Personally, I get a little jittery walking up and down stairs with very breakable stuff like glasses so I'm not such a fan of this. My favorite location is the one on Bolyston Street which has an escalator and is just laid out a lot nicer."
365,2,"Meh. Ive experienced MUCH better. 1st let me say one of my new years resolutions was to expand my yoga practice and try out as many east bay locations as made sense, this one was the worst so far so i was shocked to see all the great reviews???
  The receptionist was kind, welcoming and inviting.
 My 1st class was with Kevin who was saying  lines that ive heard at other studios like ""this nice little community we're building"" this is always what they say at Yoga to the People. He also was abrasive in his tone and said  things that were pretty rude and insulting to the practice and philosophy of yoga, I felt like I was in a HS gym class, till the end when he came around and put sticky mint gel on my neck w/o asking! It was so crazy, people do have allergies
 . I was sad to see there was a 1st timer in there with way to many clothes on including socks and Kevin offered him NO help, advice or adjustments. It seemed like this guy is riding the yoga train to get financial gain, but his practice and instruction need much more development. yes he got a prime location and did a nice job with the studio but the sincerity and heart is missing.
    The second class was a late night class with Bethany and it was good, but she's new to town - maybe yet to experience a more authentic studio/energy.
   So mad props to all the other teachers. And YOU may find a good class here but go check it out for your self!
      Flying yoga has much better class variety with similar fast work out classes, so does square one yoga and namaste. My favorite of course so far is Yoga Kula...

PS: one last thing..please have gender neutral bathrooms...
        good luck and maybe i'll try again next year....after this studio has 
        some time to settle in."
366,3,"I stop by this store around 8PM.
Parking was really hard to find, but luckily I found one after search around about 10 min.
This was 2 storage building which they have a seat at second floor also.
I search the menu and this place more close to Korean food then Japanese.
Price was very reasonable.
I ordered Spicy Pork bulgogi bento and Miso soup, and it cost me not over 8 bucks.
I been lived Los Angles for 17 years, so my taste for Korean food is very spoiled.
When I tried to taste my food...well it was not great, but it was okay taste to me if you think about the price.
Miso soup was not that great, and spicy pork was little too much sauce on it. But for the overall taste when I consider here is Pittsburgh it was pretty okay to me.
I watched around what kind of the other people order here, and most of people was eating bulgogi ( Korean style rib eye) or garbi (Korean style BBQ short rib).
I re command you try bulgogi bento or Gari Bento."
367,3,"Meh. it's decent Thai takeout. It's close to the office and we get it every now and again.

I wouldn't call it a destination spot, but if you're in the area, it'll do.

Also, don't be too hungry for lunch. We split 3 dishes between 3 people and were nibbling on our fingers a couple of hours later."
368,2,"I went to Hotel Zaza, or the restaurant/lounge in the hotel, a few days ago. I'll give them this...the decoration was beautiful..very appealing to the eye. The bar/lounge are was nice. Nice crowd, big patio..so far so good. THEN we decided to get a table and have some dinner. After the hostess sat us it took about 5-10 minutes for the waiter to come to out table (mind u there is about 3 other parties in there so it wasn't cuz he was busy)  When he does grace us with his presence he was very short with us..and slightly rude...as if he was just too good to talk us. We didn't hear any specials...recommendations..nothing. It took about 30 minutes for our food to be served to us...which would've been fine if maybe the waiter came by and checked on ur during that time of let us know why our food even appetizers were taking so long. We got nothing. When the food does get there..its not serve by our previous waiter but who cares! I'm starving. I had the deconstructed ahi roll..it's an appetizer..but filling enough to be a meal. It was good...great? No...but definitely good. We had other appetizers such as the the nachos, which were alright..i mean u really can't mess up nachos, and the crab cakes, which were the size of hush puppies but very good! The waiter never came to check on us until it was time to clear our plates. He then comes back with menus and asks if we'd like a dessert. Before we got to answer him and say no, he had already walked away. WoW. about 5-8 minutes later he comes back again and asks if we'd like dessert we say no and he gives us our check...when he comes back and drops off the cc receipt he put in on the table and walks off...doesn't say thank you...have a great night..nothing at all. I could not believe it. So although the food was OK I don't think it made up for the lack of customer service. I would never step foot in that restaurant again."
369,1,"Until you've gone to Stanford you can't really imagine the sort of bizzare depression that afflicts people who have everything going for them. The faculty usually develop permanent apathy once they achieve tenure. The undergraduate community is overwhelmed by choice and lots of kids lose their direction. The graduate community is completely out of place and forced to live in an Olympic village type thing. 

Worst decision I ever made."
370,3,"Go for the drinks, not the food!  

Bandwagon offers a really solid selection of beers, wine and liquor. And I appreciate that it has a more welcoming environment than Ale House for a 30s and 40s crowd.  The only problem is the food is pretty subpar. Out of the four times I've eaten there, I've been sick to my stomach twice.  My advice is to just stick to the fries!"
371,3,"I went to Green Street restaurant on a Sunday for Brunch. Make sure you make a reservation because this place can get quite busy on the weekend. The décor of the restaurant was intimate, and the service was good. Not only that the food portions were enormous. I could barely finish my meal and on top of that I had ordered pancakes on the side. For what you get, the food was decently priced."
372,3,"i like the fact that there's beer, coffee and wifi here.  but i can't hear myself think, cuz the muzic is so fucking loud."
373,3,"Garish lighting, hard plastic seats, and mediocre diner fare.  On the other hand, open 24/7, fast service, cheap, and very very tolerant of loud, obnoxious, uncooperative, and drunken clientele (which, admittedly, my friends and I were last Friday.  Correction: my friends were; I, as DD, unfortunately (?) was not).  Final assessment: Excellent place to sober up (or not) after a prolonged night of drunken debauchery in downtown Champaign.  Probably wouldn't go there otherwise, because being the lone sober one at an otherwise mediocre diner sucks =P"
374,3,"Went there on a Friday for lunch.  They were really under staffed and it took forever to get waited on but, the nachos were superb.  We will absolutely be going back for the nachos.  Three stars for the poor service."
375,3,"The prices are a little too high for college kids (dinner ranges from $7.95 to $13.50)...but at least this place has some unique dishes to add a little flavor to College Park. I admit I have only tried a couple dishes here so far--everything has been good, but I don't really eat meat so there aren't too many choices for me. 

I HIGHLY recommend the homemade Pine/Ginger drink."
376,3,"I'm undecided about Garcia's.  It's kitschy, so that's cool, but it's not kitschy in an ironic way, and more in an odd way.  The wooden beams and the layout is nice, and the pizza is no frills--and they're serious about carding you, something I haven't had to deal with in awhile.

The pizza was adequate, not necessarily remarkable, but got the job done, and I was impressed that they had Blue Moon on tap (and NO crappy beers, great job, Garcia's).  That said, Garcia's gets a 3 star ""Meh.""

You get the job done, but I'm not convinced I'm gonna be a fan yet.  I'll give you a little time when I finally move to C-U."
377,2,"The negative reviews don't surprise me.  There's always one problem or another with the The Bubble House, and most of the issues can be boiled down to poor customer service.  Granted, I'm pretty patient, and if I'm in the area in need of some serious boba, I'll stick it out.  I mean, their Thai Tea doesn't flat out suck, after all.  But, as the two star rating says, ""Meh.  I've experienced better.""

To its credit, the interior is quite cool.  I sort of want to live there."
378,3,"As others said, typical Hampton Inn. Yes, valet parking only. Warnings from a native to not walk around at night. Yes it sorta adjoins GaTech, but not necessarily close to the section of GaTech you'll want to visit, so check that first. Staff was great. Nothing really 'wowed' me, typical free breakfasts consisting of powdered eggs and yogurts and breads and messy waffle machines that unattended children have wreaked unholy havoc upon. For a 3 star review, I don't mean it to be necessarily negative, but again, overall in comparison to any other Hampton, it was average."
379,2,"Came here for brunch on a Sunday and boy was is busy,  was difficult to find the host stand but once we did the seating was immediate. I was dying for eggs Benedict and a BloodyMary and got just that.  The server was very and didn't rush during our order taking. 

The Guacomole unimpressive as was the Bloodymary.  When the food arrived, it appeared enticing and flavorful until I bit into a nasty charred burnt piece of ham.  Later, after we all discussed how everyones dish wasn't anything special, I had about 18 hrs of indigestion and nausea ( and I have a iron clad stomach, takes alot to upset me). 

I don't think i will be visiting Trudy's again. I did however like the art work.  And no TV's upstairs for game watching."
380,3,"Went to Hon for dinner with some college friends back in February 2010. I'm a big fan of any Asian food. I was excited to see a restaurant serving Japanese and Korean food. But I was slightly disappointed at this place. The biggest downside is the price. It's expensive. I orded Korean pancake and pay about $14 for it. The pancake was small, flat, and slightly tasteless. It was my first time eating Korean pancake, so I didn't realized how unsatisfactory it was until I had Korean pancake in NYC. One of my friends had bibimbap, and it was pretty small. And they don't offer many side dishes (banchan).
It was pretty empty when my friends and I went. Considering TCNJ, Riders Univ, and Princeton Univ are nearby, but due to the high prices of the food can explain why college students are not going there."
381,2,"Several of my friends have gotten sick from eating the barbecue from Steve's.  It's the kind of place that you might like if you prefer quantity over quality - and there's nothing wrong with that!  But if it's just gonna make you sick then the large portions are sort of pointless.  I usually get the tofu soup from there, and I have to say, Berkel Berkel's is definitely better.  You can hardly taste anything even after you ask them to make it spicy."
382,3,"This review for Soy Japanese Grill and Roll is BARELY a 3-star...more like a 2.5-star. I was driving around the USC area looking for a Japanese place that wouldn't cost me an arm and a leg for lunch. Soy looked promising!

I went in. It was moderately busy, it was clean, it seemed good. The menu is very limited and a little too expensive than I hoped. I didn't intend to spend as much as I did - $8 for a roll - but I did. What I was surprised to hear was that the roll came with a choice of salad! Huzzah! Shredded cabbage accompanied my crunch roll.

The roll was average. Nothing amazing. The salad? Boring. But hey at least I got some greens in my system. Soy's philosophy is healthy Japanese fast food. I respect that. The service was also young, bright and alive. But I'd rather put my money into FLAVOR. I only have a week or so left working in the area, so I don't think I'll be returning."
383,3,Simply put: the food is cheap.  There is really nothing special about the place except it closes late and it is in the Asian Cuisine area in UC Berkeley.  The food is exactly what you would expect from a cheap thai place.  They are semi-helpful with dietary needs.  Just because I gave it three stars does not mean I would not go back to enjoy a cheap and simple thai meal.  I would recommend this place.
384,3,"The food was good the prices were a little high for the quantity. I would have given more stars if the food quantity was bigger. 

I had the pibil tacos which were good. I always try to judge the quality of Mexican food by how they prepare their pork. The flavor was good, good mix of spices. The tacos had pickled onions on top that were good and complimented the pork well. I chose the green salsa and it was okay not spicy at all which was a little disappointing. The tortillas are hand made which are great. 

All in all check it out if you are in the area and hungry, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there."
385,3,"So there are 2 of these, this is the worse of the 2. Maybe the other one benefits from not being right in the middle of Harvard Sq. 

Too crowded. Good beer. Good pizza. I always think the snack sticks on the bar are decoration, but my friends swear no, so I play along. Spicy! I wished it were as spacious as the Boylston St one."
386,2,"It's such a shame to have a store with such an awesome array of clothing that is soooo lacking in basic customer service skills. The cashier was snippy with a god-complex. When I asked her what she thought of an item I was considering buying she rudely said, ""how am I supposed to know?"" 

Will I go back? Only if there's something truly extraordinary in the window. If I think they sell it anywhere else, I'll quickly take my business elsewhere."
387,2,"A local place showing indie flicks (correction: flick) you would otherwise have to travel to bigger cities like Boston or NYC to watch? Check. Unfortunately, that's pretty much the only thing I can say that this theater has going for it. 

I do have an appreciation for Avon's old school feel but I do not enjoy its cramped dilapidated seating, musky odor, and sub-standard screen quality and sound. I am also unimpressed by the lack of variety in their film offerings. Maybe if they showed more than one movie at a time..and if they stopped showing that same movie for weeks and weeks on end..until I've stopped really paying attention to what they're showing because I've already assumed that it's the same thing they showed the week before..maybe then I would be more inclined to pay Avon a visit. 

Even then I'd rather be reaching in my pocket for a $5 matinee ticket or student discount (read: does not exist) than the $9.50 one price fits all. Avon, you can do so much better."
388,3,"My landlady who had spent a year in the peace corps in India, recommended that my classmate and I go to Udupi. Although I am pretty clueless when it comes to Indian food (even how to eat it), I thought I would give it a try. 

I wasn't too blown away by this restaurant. My classmate who knows her Indian food also agreed with me (we talked about giving this place 3/5 stars. haha.) For an appetizer, we got the Idly. It was okay... not that I really knew (my landlady proceeded to mash hers all around, while my classmate and I took small bites), but it was okay. We then ordered the Onion & Hot chili Uthappam and the Channa Batura. 

The Uthappam was actually pretty okay, and I liked how it was spicy. It reminded me of a Chinese green onion pancake. The Channa Batura was also okay. I'm not sure what it was missing. Some type of kick or wow factor? I did, however, like the masala tea. 

This place is definitely hidden in the middle of a strip plaza.. and would be an okay place to satisfy a craving. Maybe next time I'm in the area I'll try something else.... 

Perhaps we ordered the wrong specialties. I had wanted to try the curry, but had no room for that. Udupi Palace also has a ton of rich desserts in a glass case...which my companions did not want to eat... so i did not try those as well."
389,2,"Okay, this place is vile.  I'm sorry to everyone up here in the northeast, but you don't load your ""tex-mex"" with so much garlic that you can't taste anything else.  Even without the whole garlic thing, the food just is soggy and plan disgusting.  I've had better ""Mexican"" style food out of the freezer section at Shaw's."
390,3,"After enjoying a lovely meal at Craigie on main, we passed on  having a dessert there because we wanted to end our night at Toscanini's, which is literally beside the restaurant.  This place was voted best ice Cream in Boston in the classic category by Boston Mag.  We entered the shop and it was as packed, mostly students in very casual dressing.  I ordered the Hydrox ice cream, which i actually had no clue what that was, and they informed me that it was the original Oreo.  My ice cream was good but i must say it was not the best i have had.  

Overall, i would go back because there were many flavours that intrigued me and the area that surrounds it  is great."
391,3,Hole in the wall Mexican tacos and burritos. The closest you can get to decent Southern Californian Mexican food in Manhattan.
392,1,"We had a Groupon and I was excited as I grew up in Istanbul and I love Doner Kebap.
Doner Kebap (or as widely known by its Greek version ""Gyro"") was made popular in Germany by Turkish immigrants. 

Very's version however is a far cry from how it should be done. The bread falls apart, there is very little meat in there and whatever is in there lacks any flavor.  At first glimpse, it is a huge sandwich and has some eye appeal due to the colorful veggies stashed in there, but it s mostly bread :( Folks, it is not how a proper Doner Kebap should be done at all. 

I would have probably cried if I had to pay the full price."
393,2,"Came here because of the absinthe menu. Bartender was an idiot. Didn't know what he was talking about. And rude. I ordered a ""death in the afternoon"" which is a common absinthe cocktail made with champagne. He insisted it was a shot. It's not. Look it up. He was rude about. Waitress and manager made it right, but then the waitress made it seem like I was being difficult. Cool place, unfriendly staff."
394,1,"My mom and I had groupon's for this place and we learned our lessons too!! I had to argue with the lady giving my pedicure about shaving off my calluses for like 10 mins. It was exhausting. They were trying to sell us everything and then insulted us when we didn't want anything extra. At one point, some lady handed me a phone and we had to argue with the owner(who did not speak English) about whether our groupon was expired. We were finally able to get one of the girls to read that it clearly wasn't expired. Ugh, we will not go back to this place!!"
395,1,"the only good thing about this place is the selection of $5 footlongs.

the people making my sandwich were unfriendly. there were no smiles on their faces, and they practically barked at me when they asked for my preferences.
sandwich making wasn't so hot either. the veggies were unevenly spreads out, and the lady cut and wrapped my sandwich without even trying to close the sandwich. made eating it so much more difficult than it needed to be...

i really wish that i had read these yelp reviews before coming here. the $5 spent on this sandwich could have been made for better use at a local restaurant..."
396,1,"Wahoo's Tacos are wahoo! no more.  We stopped by for some famous fish tacos to go.  One bite made me wish I had some sour cream, cheese and guac to smother the flavorless fish.  All I got was a mouthful of dry cabbage and tortilla, even the salsa let me down.  If they can't get their namesake right, then they should probably consider renaming their eatery."
397,2,"Really not impressed by this place.

Too loud. Too dark. Prices are nothing to write home about.
Our plates were dirty. The glasses had something on them, too.

There were lots of different items on the menu, which was cool. They were also accommodating to my friend, who wanted paneer + tikki masala. Naan was a little burnt.

I also hate to say it, but the person who refilled our waters had a bad B.O.

This place was relatively speedy, though, and obviously can accommodate large parties."
398,2,"If you enjoy the smell of urine, Bull's Tavern is the place for you.  If you don't, come here on your friend's 21st to watch them take the Bull Sweat then never come back!"
399,2,"How is Native Foods in The OC 10x better than Native Foods in Westwood when it comes to the dining in experience? 'Tis a chain, but one could be fooled.

Native Foods in Westwood is really a terrible place to eat inside the restaurant and I will never eat in there again - maybe takeout, never inside. I'm sure the takeout service is fine, but there's only space for about 10 people or so in the dining area (located upstairs) that is filled with unbalanced tables and far away from the regular warm water dispenser by the register that sprays water all over your hands like a drunken and irresponsible pee in a public restroom. 

My food arrived lukewarm to cold (French Dip sandwich), which made it neither taste like a deli sandwich, nor a hot off the grill veggie spectacular. Instead, it tasted like someone forgot to bring it to our table for a really long time - really big letdown, considering I really enjoyed my food at The OC NF. My Greens were really good in taste, but lukewarm again. I'm sure that none of this is helped by the fact that the dining area is engulfed in a baby hurricane from the ceiling fan that is about .0005% as cool as the giant one in The OC.

Cramped, lukewarm, far from the water, same prices as The OC - if I go to Native Foods to try and impress people with some ""better than you'd think"" vegetarian foods, I'll be sure to hang out with Ryan, Seth, Summer, Marissa, and Taylor Townsend (mmm dreamy Autumn Reeser...) in The OC instead of this buttload of soy protein disappointment.

Californiaaaa.....Californiaaaaaaa.... Here we COMMMMMMMMMMMMEEE!!!!! (I miss you, OC)."
400,2,"I recently bought some stuff to clean out my DSLR sensor, so I can't claim to be a high roller at this place. However, I agree that the customer service could be better. The staff seem so overworked, or under-motivated, to help you. In addition, every time I ask how much it is to get the sensor professionally cleaned, I get a different answer from a different person. Something tells me that the employees here aren't being treated well by their employer, and, naturally, take it out on the customers. And yes, parking in Westwood Village is ridiculous. Their parking should be free for at least an hour so that the customer can have time to shop in peace."
401,1,"I was craving Thai food and decided to try to a new place. That was a mistake. The crab rangoons were not fully cooked and were extremely soupy. My Pad Thai was far from crispy and was dripping in grease. Despite the amount of grease, my chicken was beyond dry and I had to drink water to get the piece down. Both items were cold. I understand that  take-out is not going to be piping hot, but I expect it to be relatively warm,  To say that my craving was not met would be the better part of ordering from here. I got through half (because I paid for it, and it was not cheap) only to get sick. I for one will never order from here again, and recommend that no one does, unless you are looking for soggy, greasy food, then by all means, this is the place for you."
402,1,"Stopped to grab dinner after a quick shopping trip with my daughter.  Not impressed.  I will say it was clean, but the service was lacking, but was 10 times better than the food.  I ordered a salmon salad and they didn't have the salsa that comes with it and they didn't have the chicken pesto sandwich at all.  They also didn't have any ciabatta bread!  It's a bakery! How do you not have bread.  I have been to an ABC in another state and I always loved it, but this was horrible.  I will never stop here again!"
403,1,"Awful, horrible, disgraceful.  I have never in my life been treated so poorly.  I asked for a pedi and polish change and was the only person there and only 4 people were working.  After 2 minutes a flood of people came in, and they did their usual, it will only be 5 minutes to the newcomers.

The person barely took off my old polish- which was red and did a very sloopy job of putting on the new polish, so bad you could see the raises in the polish and still see red underneath and on the sides.  I told him this was not good but he ignored me and left.

The quickest and most rushed pedicure of my life- 15 minutes and with minimal callus scrubbing and cuticle trimming he was done.  I showed him my hands and said I am fine with the feet being bad, but my hands need to be cleaned up- this was not acceptable.  He screamed at me removed my polish and told me to leave.  

When I explained I was looking for a new nail place close to my home and I could be a very good customer to them he shouted I don't want you to be customer, I didn't force you to come here.

This was the second time I've had a bad manicure/polish change I will never return.  After the ""manager's"" rant the two girls who were waiting left immediately- I am EMBARRASSED for this salon and the real owner/manager.  AWFUL PLACE  

Good massage chairs- so 1 star"
404,2,"This is one of those places that DEFINITELY needs an update.

The first time I went there was for a friends birthday dinner about 3 years ago.... and it was good. I enjoyed the food and service. Probably worthy of 4 stars.

Since then I've returned a number of times, and have discovered that the only real thing of interest was the avocado curry they had (have?). I really don't like avocados (flavor or texture), but some of my friends love 'em.

Otherwise I think they are very much lacking in the service department (slow, not friendly) and their food has either been so-so or disappointing.

I'm kind of glad I only have one quarter left until I graduate from UW, because either I'm getting pickier or a lot of the University Way joints are going downhill. 

In any case... this is yet another U-District joint that's going on my ""skip them"" list."
405,1,"Went in for fills.  The guy took super long, trimmed my nails unevenly, then I found out they charge an extra $3 for trimming.  You're gonna make me pay more just for CUTTING MY NAILS?  Seriously."
406,1,"After taking my parents here to dinner for my dad's birthday this past week, I thought ""this place must have switched ownership"". Sure enough, come on Yelp to find out my hunch was right. 

I have to admit that I had not been here for a few years, but MacArthur Park used to be a bustling, top-notch restaurant. I had a bad feeling when we walked in for dinner at 6:30 and there were only 5 other parties in the restaurant. 

As a steak lover, I went with the larger New York (I believe 12 oz.). It was hands down one of the worst steaks I've ever had - the meat was as tough as a brick and took repeated back and forth slicing just to cut through.  

For dessert, we went with the mud pie. For god's sake, if you are going to leave the mud pie sitting in the freezer for extended periods of time, at least heat it up a little before serving. The ice cream in the mud pie was crunchy due to all the ice that had formed.

I wouldn't have paid half of what we paid for this meal. At $45 a person, there are MUCH better options in Palo Alto. Please do yourself a favor and pick one of those restaurants. Their only saving grace is that they make a pretty good bloody mary."
407,1,Yuck.
408,2,"i'm really confused about the great reviews on here. i had high hopes for damon & pythias and was let down. how can you fuck up a chicken ceasar sandwich?! it was literally the most bland sandwich i've ever had...and i'm used to eating plain turkey sandwiches. i was so stoked for the garlic fries too because garlic is basically my life but that shit was nasty! 

i haven't gone back in two years so i'll definitely try it again before i move out of westwood just to give them a fair shot. i really WANT to like it cuz of their cute patio and everything but if you mess up a classic like chicken caesar...that's just crazy."
409,2,"I've pondered Mama Palma's for a long time, and I think I've come up with a theory. Everybody needs an option for a Friday night or whatever when you want to do, you know, SOMEthing for dinner, but you don't want to put in any substantial effort or do anything out of the comfort zone. It seems like for many people the idea of ""gourmet pizza"" so perfectly fits that role, that anything else associated with the experience doesn't matter. For those people the negative aspects of actually eating at Mama Palma's, which have been well documented, are no match for how well the question of 'what to do tonight' can sometimes be answered by the IDEA of Malma Palmas."
410,2,"Occasion: Late night dinner/finals break with friends for Five Guys grand opening 

What I Had: 
Little Bacon Cheeseburger with grilled onions, mushrooms, lettuce, mustard, ketchup, BBQ sauce
Five Guys style fries 
Cajun style fries 

Food Review: I've said it before, and I'll say it again: You can't neglect the bun. The Five Guys burger made that mistake. The bun was too dry and flaky and not spongy enough. The ingredients inside the burger were all fresh, but there was nothing that differentiated this burger to make it definitively a Five Guys burger. Their ""Toppings"" menu included tomatoes, pickles, lettuce, ketchup, relish, jalapeno peppers, mustard, and other rather standard items. Nothing unique like The Counter's crispy onion strings or the Office Burger's arugula. In addition, the sauces in all of our burgers were a bit overwhelming. In my burger especially, they had included quite a lot of BBQ sauce to the point where I could no longer taste any other ingredient.  

There was also nothing special about their Five Guys fries: they were comparable to home-baked french fries, but with no special sauces or condiments like In-N-Out's animal fries. Actually our little group was sharing the a Five Guys and a Cajun style fries, and it was difficult to taste the difference because the Cajun style fries were seasoned mostly at the top of the bag. 

Not to mention, In-N-Out also has a much bigger bang for your buck. 

Service Review: Everyone was very friendly and we didn't experience an excessive wait. The line was actually rather short for opening night! 

Venue Review: The restaurant is located right beneath our apartment on Fig and 27th, so it's very convenient. There is limited street parking, and some parking available for other restaurants like the Taco Bell next door. There is limited outdoor seating, but a decent seating indoors. The venue is most appropriate for small- to medium-size parties, but the tables can easily be arranged to accommodate for a larger group (4+ people).  

Overall Impression: Although there are locations in the Bay, this was my first time trying Five Guys. Many people have told me beforehand that it pales in comparison to In-N-Out, and I have to agree. Of the fast food burger chains, In-N-Out is still the #1 in Cali."
411,1,Extremely disappointed. Stoped in to grab a simple slice with nobody there ended up waiting 40 mins (never heard of such a thing in my life). Staff is extremely unfriendly but food is decent.
412,2,"This place is dying a slow death.  I went two months ago on a Tuesday, and the whole freaking tap wall was not working!!!  They said I could buy a bottle, but why bother when there's Gingerman within walking distance?

The ironic thing is that I ended up getting Leffe Blonde in a bottle, but Hans' didn't carry that.

That weekend I came back with other friends, thinking the tap wall was fixed.  Only half were working...  and the beers that we did get, they were all flat.

The only other times I came here was for the St. Arnold' crawls.

On a positive note, since this place really isn't busy, you can play bocce ball in peace. This would be the only reason I would come back."
413,2,"The store is nice and big inside, but it always seems like they are low on stocks.  I've been waiting to purchase a certain Stila lipstick and they never have it on the shelf.  I think this place is good if you come with their coupons, which is usually $3.50 off $10 or 20% off, but make sure your coupon is compatible with the products you are purchasing.  

They have BOGO or buy 1 get 1 half off deals periodically on brands you can buy at Target or RIte Aid.  When I used to purchase Physicians Formula products, Ulta was the perfect place for them."
414,2,Reminds me of an upstart comic book shop. There are a few back issues to choose from... Some magic cards.... Worth a look if you're in Lansingburg....
415,1,"Today was the third time in as many years I've eaten at the Trio House located at 3031 S. Figueroa St. Los Angeles, CA. (Near USC) 

I don't recall what I had the first time but I made a mental note how horrible the food was. The second time I went because everyone in my office decided they wanted to go to the Trio House....so I went. Again I don't recall what I had but I swore I'd never eat there again because the food was so nasty.

Today, one of my office partners suggested the Trio House. Not giving it much thought I went along. I ordered the broccoli with chicken. Here is my assessment of the food today.

Chicken: I took one bite of the chicken and nearly gagged. Can't describe the flavor other than to say it was akin to something that belonged in the bowl of a toilet. 

Salad: The salad was eatable but not good. On a scale of 1 to 10, (10 being great) I would say it was a 3. 

Broccoli: The broccoli felt like it had been left out on the counter all night where it got very limp. The pieces were scrawny and appeared to be old. 

Rice: The rice was the only thing that was good. 

When I told the male waiter how horrible my meal was, he simply said ""sorry"". He could see all the uneaten food on my plate yet he felt necessary to charge the entire price. I wrote on the credit card receipt, ""Worst chicken I ever had, I will Yelp this"".

Additional Information:
This is a fairly nice looking restaurant from the outside and inside. Unfortunately, no one there knows how to cook and in today's case, they may have been serving rat meat.

The fountain near the front entrance was leaking and caused a huge water puddle and none of the employees cared to mop it up until we pointed it out. It was no small puddle either and was a major safety and liability hazard.

My recommendation....don't eat at this place. Let the USC kids eat there. They probably won't know any difference anyway. 
For me....NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
416,2,"I had a senior hair stylist. She was slow, but I expected that since they don't have much experience. I got a full hair color and cut. The color was pretty nice. The cut itself wasn't even noticeable... After 2 hours, my hair basically looked the same."
417,2,"Their food used to be good when they just opened, but it has not been the same since then.  It's not as tasty and very inconsistent.  I'm not sure what happened.  I'll have to say that I was disappointed last time I went there."
418,1,"Don't go there. I've been insulted like never before just because I wanted an explanation about the destruction of some buttons on my shirts... Among other things, the guy told me that he ""doesn't give a shit about the customers"" and that the customers are ""little bitches""... It's not a joke : the guy almost hit me and I was about to call the police. I finally decided to go and move on... DO NOT GO THERE !!!"
419,1,"Hells to the no. I dont know what I was thinking the first time. Maybe within that year, the quality has gone down but yeah.... Last time I got it, super oily and made my stomach hurt the next morning. My friend got it recently and he was moaning from the pain in his stomach. Maybe there was some bad meat or something :( I avoid this place now."
420,1,"I really wanted to like this place because I live right next door and drink a lot of coffee. 

The first time I came in, a man in front of me ordered a non-fat latte. The barista looked at him in utter confusion, like shed never heard of such a thing before. He went on to explain what a non fat latte was, how to make it, and most embarassingly, where the non fat milk was! (""The milk with the blue cap... not that one.. to the right.. blue cap, says ""skim milk""). Took so long I had to leave and go some where else.

Second time I ordered a latte. ""Our espresso machine is down"". Tried to order a coffee. ""$5 minimum on debit cards"". Ugh. I again left empty handed.

Third time I finally got my latte. Or what they call a latte, I would call it a Cafe au Lait. Latte implies the milk is steamed. You can't just put milk in espresso and call it a latte, guys.

Never coming again. Like I said, I really tried. Over priced. Unless you have cash, you have to buy more than $5 of their garbage. Staff was super friendly but are probably new to making coffee."
421,2,"I heard rave reviews about Harvest and decided to schedule a lunch meeting there.  Unfortunately it was too cold to sit on the fabulous patio.  Maybe if i had, it would have been a better experience.  The waiter was wonderful but that was about the only aspect I enjoyed.  We were seated toward the front of the restaurant and were swarmed with people coming in and out, proving very distracting and breezy.  I had the lobster roll recommended to me but it was very messy and had an overpowering onion effect on the remainder of my day.  Quite unfortunate.  I don't plan on going back for lunch but might be willing to try cocktail hour."
422,2,"After eating here, I felt as though I had been licked clean through at least 10 square miles of Utah's Great Salt Lake.  I have to say, I like a bit of salt here and there throughout my diet, but border cafe took it to a new level.

I started with a magarita: salt is to be expected here.  No surprises thus far.  Next were the standard Mexican-cantina chips & salsa.  The chips were fantastically skewed in the salty direction, but again - not a huge surprise.  Finally, my fajitas arrived, completely putting me over the edge.  From that point forward, I retained every sip of liquid I had over the next 36 hours.  It was ugly.

The atmosphere was nothing to write home about, either.  I wasn't disappointed by the margarita, though."
423,1,"We wanted to like the Apple Farm, we really did.  But when I have to wait almost an hour in a half-deserted restaurant for an $11 plate of bacon and eggs, I just can't muster anything more than one star.  Judging from the complaining coming from the tables around us, I'm probably not alone.

The Apple Farm has been in SLO since the mid-70's, I believe, so it is sort of a local institution.  We've known people who have stayed in their Country/Victorian style rooms and not heard any raves or rips other than comments about their rates being overly high.  Through the years we've visited their gift shop on occasion and we've dined there once or twice in the pre-YELP days, with nothing particularly memorable to report.

So it was Saturday morning, we wanted a decent breakfast and the Apple Farm was very near our hotel.  

First it took forever for wait staff to arrive - STRIKE ONE.  Then it took forever for our meal to come, with no explanation whatsoever - STRIKE TWO.  Finally, Karla's eggs were hard as rocks and it took forever for fresh ones to be cooked.  By then the waitress was starting to realize that customers were not happy.  She became very attentive and even brought us a muffin as consolation for the slow kitchen.  We appreciated that but the damage had already been done.  Overall the meal was lackluster at best.  

Since the Apple Farm probably makes most of its money on tourists and not on locals, who undoubtedly know better values can be found elsewhere, my guess is this place will continue getting away with serving Yugo-style food at Mercedes-like prices.  What do they care if a tourist passing through never comes back?  Well, maybe the power of YELP will make a difference.

In the meantime, I've not been to a Denny's in years, but you'd be better off finding one of those than going to the Apple Farm."
424,2,"I bought a pair of Coach heels at my last visit to DSW, so was really excited to see what the LJ store had for me.

I'm in the market for silver bridesmaid shoes and didn't find much of a selection. 

In fact, I didn't find anything that even caught my interest.

Disappointed...

Note: The Mission Valley location is bigger and has more variety."
425,2,"On a recent lunch visit, our service here was fine. But they seemed to have changed their crab cake from what I remember a couple of years ago. You can find some images of that one around the web - you'll know because it appears to have been fried in a pan (which is probably the only way to treat a crab cake).

What I got was about a half-cup scoop of soft crab glop, which appeared to have been heated up right on the plate. It had spread some in place and was stuck to the plate a bit. The top was lightly browned in a few spots, but the bottom was about room temperature - my guess is that it wasn't broiled, but perhaps had a torch or flame run over it a bit to brown it lightly.

There was a fair amount of crab in it, but it was not what anyone would call a crab cake. It was warm, chunky crab salad. Perhaps it should be listed as such. . ."
426,1,The customer service is absolutely REVOLTING. They will have a few dozen people in line and management will be chatting away instead of going and working the cash register. I DREAD GOING INTO THIS STORE.
427,1,"Awful customer service.  Purchased bed set and mattress set. Melissa placed the order for me. Instead of charging for the set, she priced items individually which cost me a couple hundred dollars more. Called the store many times. Each time Arlina, the manager, promised to set the record straight. She never did. I had to call the 800 customer service number to finally get my money back. They just seem indifferent. For the mark-up I pay at the store, I expect a lot more! Don't go there."
428,2,Came here when I was really hungry with a friend and we ordered Hawaiian BBQ Chicken and Hawaiian BBQ Beef but both were fail. Beef was way too greasy and dry at the same time and not soft enough to cut with plastic knives. It felt like I was chewing paper... Chicken was better than beef I guess but we didn't enjoy any of our meals even when we were both starving.
429,1,"OMB! I have never purchased an item, asked for a receipt, but in return for the manager to tell me to not only refuse to give me a receipt, but to check my ""bank statement"" as confirmation of my purchase! HOW RIDICULOUS IS THAT?! 

So I placed an order online 3 days ago online, the purchase was pending, but I could not go to the final tab and print out a copy of my invoice. NOR DID I get a confirmation email. How is this even possible? I didn't even get any sort of confirmation and for them to ""pend"" my purchase.

Monday, after going to the store and talking both a clerk and manager, learning that there was no record of my purchase.. I went home to double check, still NO CONFIRMATION EMAIL!... I still had the page with my order and cc info open, miraculously I was able to go to the 6th step... and printed out a copy of my ""invoice"" with only information consisting : time and date of consumption, ""CA"", and ""order number""... I assumed everything was going smoothly...

Tuesday, today! I went there, still troubles. The invoice was not even a legit invoice... only the information listed above.. talked to the manager.. he gave me the reader I ordered.. he had me sign a form... and I ASKED for a copy of the receipt... and back to what I initially said... to check my ""bank statement"", NO RECEIPT!?...

Came home.. double checked my bank acct... a DOUBLE PENDING TRANSACTION FROM Copy Central?.... WTH?!...


******1. OBVIOUSLY, better CUSTOMER SERVICE required!
******2. More efficient computer programming!"
430,2,"I travel to DC every week - and usually take the shuttle to the MARC train in the morning.  No trains tonight - so tried this one .. which almost worked well.

Two stops at BWI:  One is near the BEGINNING of Terminal A.  To get to this stop - find the first rental car stop and cross the road to get to the middle island.  The second stop is at the far end - across from the light rail.  

The bus stopped at the terminals .. picking us up ..  then looped around to the business district stop .. and made a second pass through the terminals - stopping again and picking up more passengers.  Seems like this is awfully inefficient.

I caught the last bus of the night.  It was 10 minutes late - and so arrived at Greenbelt 10 minutes late - which was 2 minutes after the last train left.

About 30 of us were there - so they ran another train into town for us.   Took a while but it worked out OK."
431,2,"Overpriced, hippy clothing. No door greet, just obvious stares. Might as well wear rags."
432,2,Uncomfortably warm in there last night.. ugh I couldn't wait to leave!
433,1,"Shameful.  This place has really awful delivery but despite knowing this, still went for Mother's Day dinner.  

The drinks are majorly overpriced, the food is solidly mediocre and underflavored.  It was easy to rack up a $250 bill for 6 people with two rounds of drinks, but the food was so tasteless, I found myself dredging everything in the Cholula sauce on the table.  

On top of everything, the table was sharp on the underside and kept catching on my clothing.

Being in a neighborhood with amazing Spanish food you would think the chefs would challenge the competition with such a huge restaurant and high prices.  I literally was so disappointed I wanted my money back.

Havana Central misrepresents Spanish food in every way--and I hope visitors realize this place really sucks!"
434,1,"Mexican food, prepared by Mexicans, in the Asian Ghetto. While it sounds like a match made in heaven, it's really not. You get big portions, but I remember a distinct smell coming from my burrito that made me want to throw it away and get food elsewhere."
435,2,"The idea for this place is great..good restaurant just across the street from 30th st station where you can grab dinner before/after the train. They even have the amtrak boards in the restaurant so you can check your train status. SOUNDS great..however..

The menu is not at all suited to a quick-ish meal pre-train.  Supposedly they used to have burgers and salads etc.but now it is a much more intense New american menu w/ fish, steaks, etc. aka nothing that you want to be rushed eating (or have them rush to make).  The most casual thing on the menu is a caesar salad which you can add shrimp or chicken to..comes with some gloppy mayo-y dressing.  I will admit that my boyfriends roast chicken and sauteed spinach were good but they took so long to bring our food that we had to take everything to go and roast chicken is not an ideal meal to eat on the little amtrak seat back tray table. 

This place needs to embrace its convenience factor and improve its efficiency (did I mention we were one of 3 tables in the restaurant and couldnt get our food w/in one hour?) ..and adjust the menu, at least adding some lighter/more portable items.   

Bottom line..im really not such a fan"
436,1,"WOW. this is literally the worst diner ive ever eaten in. The service is pretty good. but the food absolutely sucks. (with respect to their breakfast food) i havent had their gyros yet. 

I ordered the french toast. It came out as small thin slices of slightly battered white bread with very big chunks of fruit. Come on, if your going to serve fruit with the french toast (which i specifically asked for) at least dice it into smaller pieces so you can easily pick it up with a fork. And how hard is it to cut thicker slices of bread and dip them in egg. 

Well, sufficient to say I am thoroughly disappointed in the Broadway Diner. Expensive (for what you get), and you can get better food at any waffle house."
437,1,Cheap! But taste Bad!!!
438,2,"I wanted to like this place. I really did! And I DO like the staff, and kind of the food...but the staff was stellar and deserves that recognition. 

But...the food.  Eh. Am I spoiled? I may be. I have learned what more authentic Chinese is and this is not it. This is for American tastes, which really, does make sense, I guess (but why? Nostalgia, I betcha!), but still! Humph! 

Let's see...the details:

Honey Walnut Shrimp. Not what I've grown accustomed to, but not bad. I am used to a no batter-type-thing, but this seemed to have been dipped in something before being cooked. Also, the walnuts were really toasted. I mean REALLY. A bit too much, but still had an interesting flavor. Now see, the question is this - if I hadn't had it elsewhere, and more authentic, first, would I think this was really good, or just ok-good, like I do now? It's kind of hard to know that! So with my ""tainted mouth"" (ooooweee, did I *say* that?! lol!) my taste buds having been previously defiled by another restaurant, I cannot say. This was I think the 2nd best dish we tried. Read on...

I think this is the best dish we had: Peapods and Water chestnuts. I liked it a lot! And the peapods were nice and bright green and crispy, and the water chestnuts were filled with the sauce's flavor - which was also really nice. But it was *a lot* of sauce - the only caveat. Hush up! I know I'm picky...but I give the Love when the Love is due! I do, I do! (you like that play with words - deux ya?!)

Am I just a PITA in terms of Chinese? I know I don't know that much, but I am coming off like a Snootette!  

Before I shoot down any more food and have a hit put on upon myself by loyal followers, let me say this: I LOVE the interior! Granted you can still smell the old cigarette smell from back in the day when people smoked inside restaurants, but I'm a nostalgic freak and I get a weird kick out of that. It's dark - black and red, old American-Chinese in design. There is, of course, a fish tank, red booths and what is now retro hostess area. The whole feel of the place is pretty old fashioned, and I think that is kinda romantic! Even the design of the exterior and the interior, are sort of Old American Chinese. Ok, like I saw all my childhood, lol. No, I'm not old. I'm ripe. 

While there may be things lacking in terms of the food, the atmosphere really is wonderful - combine that look with great service and you've got a hit. I mean, gee, they've been there for ages. I went, I'm sure, in 1982 if not well before then, and even then, it had been there a good while. 

Ok, short and fast, like a band aid being pulled off of a scared child...chicken fried rice, too oily and seemed previously fresh....lo mien, chicken, not enough noodles and oily....Szechwan shrimp? Where is the shrimp? Where? Too few, very frustrating.  They were hard to find and the flavor very typical, average...(I have Office Space in my head, ""Has anyone seen my stapler? I left it right here and well, my stapler, it's gone, and it's my stapler and it's no longer here and I was just wondering..."")

I'm sorry. I am! But hey, I'm here to be real. Will I go back? Probably - I have an urge to sit at the bar and have snacks and drinks one day. Probably with my father (also reviewed this place - guess who he is, lol) because I have little social life and my husband is too busy and my kids are either too young or too far away, lol. But I'm being serious, I will come back and I'd love to sit at the bar and chat and snack. 

Maybe I'll see you there? That'll be me, over-analyzing myself and the Honey Walnut Shrimp at the bar..."
439,2,"The fatburger was a little below average.  Meat was dry and bland and the buns were soggy.  Fries were decent, but the entire meal is too pricey for the quality.  It didn't taste much better than your standard fast food burger (Burger King, In-N-Out), actually I would've preferred one of those.
Service was ridiculously rude.  Cashier stared at me with an attitude for a full on 10 seconds and said ""What do you want??"" after I had already told her my order, so I had to repeat it while she glared at me like I was an inconvenience.  Minus points for that.

Not worth the long wait or insult to your intelligence. Just go to Jack in the Box or something."
440,2,"TK Wu puts so much salt in their food that everything just tastes the same.  I'm also concerned about their unwillingness to give ""authentic"" menus to non-Chinese visitors.  I'd recommend going to Asian Legend around the corner instead."
441,1,"I have dreaded writing this review for about 3 months because I know its not going to be pretty. I probably had the worst food experience  of my life at this place and will most likely never set foot in this place again. Let me start off by saying it was like 2am. Me and my friend were looking for some decent food to satisfy our hunger. I figured we might as well give Landmark Diner a try. We had the best waiter ever. That wasn't the problem. Now when it came time to order I wanted the chicken gyro but he said that it  wasn't the kind of chicken i was thinkin about i Should probably order the grilled chicken gyro. I ordered the chicken gyro because I was like I think thats what I want. When the food came out I don't know what the heck it was but it looked horrible and it didn't resemble a chicken gyro at all. I took a bite and it tasted like nastiness. So I ask our waiter if I could get the grilled chicken gyro instead. He said I have to go talk to the manager and see what he says. Do you know that the manager came over to me and said, ""well he warned you about the gyro. you will have to pay half for this and then the full amount for whatever else you get."" I looked at him like he was crazy. Usually the manager wants the customer to be happy and we'll do anything including prepare another meal for the customer if they are unsatisfied. However he was different. Keep in mind I only at the two greek potatoes so I was still hungry. My waiter felt really bad. He said do you want to order somthing else. I said no...I'll just go to McDonald's and get something. We paid for our food and left. I will never....ever...go back to landmark diner in my life. The manager was horrible and doesn't know anything about proper customer service."
442,1,"Our family has frequented Kirk's for years. It has, in the past, occupied an appealing niche between low-end fast-food burgers, and upscale boutique burgers. 

However, after our last visit to Kirk's we'll never go back. We had a Kirk's Burger with cheddar which had very nearly no taste AND the added bonus of gristle. Absolutely nauseating.

As for ambiance, it's been steadily down-hill for the past several months. It's never been anything but what it professed to be, with inexpensive patio chairs and tables, besides the two booths. And that's fine for this type of quick-bites place. But lately the walls in both dining areas have been lined with head-height stacks of charcoal briquet bags. Many many charcoal briquet bags. They must have got a deal? Run out of storage elsewhere? Whatever, it had begun to feel like you were eating in their storage space, not in a public dining space. 

Nor have I ever been a fan of their fries, which are consistently dry and mealy. The onion strings are the only good thing about this place."
443,2,"The meat is WAY too salty, and undercooked. Some of the side dishes were okay but much too expensive for anything to be worth it. Not recommended, will not be back."
444,1,"OMG - this restaurant gave a new definition for nasty!!!  The restaurant stinks, it is dirty, and has awful customer service!!!  I was really apprehensive about eating hear once I walked into the door, but my friend who I was having dinner with informed me that she had read good reviews about the food and that the sushi was suppose to be excellent.  Well, we went ahead and ordered, but we were very apprehensive about even drinking the water at our table, which should have been a tell-tell sign of our insanity and why we even choose to remain.  We waited to judge to judge the experience until we received the food.  The sushi was awful - it was not good quality at all and for the price that they were charging you would have thought it would have been.  Also, the spring rolls that we were suppose to receive with shrimp - were vegetable rolls, but the waitress wanted to prove to me that the spring roll had shrimp into and started smashing the spring roll with my fork and show me that there were INVISIBLE pieces of shrimp in the spring roll and then left it there on my table for me to eat (hmm).  Of course by this time my party and I looked at each other and asked for the bill.  The waiter informed us that we had not received our main course that had already been placed.  We informed the waiter that we would not be eating the main course and that we wanted out of there!!!  I suggest that you only eat here if you want to experience what it is like to eat at a hell hole!!!  I would not send my worst enemy here to eat!!!"
445,1,"This review is coming from a person who loves food and eats just about anything, especially when I don't have to cook - I don't even mind AIRPLANE FOOD!  I cannot recall any time in my life that I have thrown away food because it was so bad, until now.

First, the items were sent to me in a box with no packing list and no dry ice that I could see.  Even though we opened the package immediately after delivery, the food was all halfway thawed out and some items had leaked so all the bags were wet and sticky.  The labels were washed off so there were some items that I could not identify and a couple of bags had distrurbingly puffed up with air.  Still, I put everything in the freezer and hoped for the best.

My kids were so excited to see peanut butter cookies, but after taking a few bites handed them back to me saying they tasted ""sour.""  Actually, all the entrees had the same STRONG vinegar flavor and a disturbing effervescence to them, even things like hash browns, vegan egg scramble, and tortilla soup.

I am dumbfounded how they can take such simple ingredients (most items were just pinto beans and rice) and make them taste so bad.  It must be the mystery ingedient of ""vegan spices"" that was on most of the labels (the ones that were still legible).  I finally just had to give up and throw about half of the food away."
446,2,"I wish you can give 2 ratings. One for service and one for the food, because the burgers that we got were great, but the service was not so good once we got our food. After they took our plates after eating. We never got service. It took us 20 mins before we got our check and that's because we asked for it. I think it was the manager who gave it to us. He gave us an excuse saying our waitress had an emergency. Why didn't they tell us or why didn't they give us another waitress. It's hard to come back to that. But I may give a try again because like I said the burgers were good."
447,1,"Disgusting, revolting, terrible, smelly, I can't think of a better way to describe this place.  I went down to U of I for a football game around Halloween and uh, if I could choose to burn one building down in my lifetime, it'd probably be Kams. Granted, I'd imagine the building is going to collapse soon due to lack of maitenance and upkeep anyway.

The second we stepped in the door the place smelled like stale beer, vomit, and pee.  My feet stuck to the floor throughout the entire bar. The tables probably hadn't been cleaned in years. I think it would have required a power washer and about 2000000 gallons of bleach to clean the place.

The bathroom was the most disgusting bathroom I've ever been in other than one in China. That's saying something.

The staff at this place was something else. The bar tender was so drunk she asked me to repeat my order of 3 bud lights 4 times in a row. She'd ask, turn around to get them, then turn around and ask what I ordered again...

The only plus to this place was for some reason it was loaded with attractive girls (have to imagine it is the cheapest place to drink on campus) and the beer and alcohol was dirt cheap.

Seriously, avoid this hole at all costs, or at least bring a clothes pin for your nose."
448,1,Is this place still in business? I hope not. I remember it was one of the most horrible dining experiences I ever had when I lived in Blacksburg. The service was incredibly slow and the quality of the food was just horrible.
449,2,"Back in high school, I used to come here every day. I thought this place was ""electic"" and ""authentic"" and was full of ""vibrant atmosphere."" I thought this place was Berkeley at its finest. 

Much later in life, I began to realize that ""eclectic"", ""authentic"" and ""vibrant atmosphere"" are just synonyms for ""urine stench"", ""lunatics with Tourette's Syndrome"" and ""too dirty even for rats and cockroaches."" However, the fact that this place is emblematic of everything that is Berkeley still rings true. 

That being said, I'm pretty sure there's still some of my old punk band's stickers stuck to the wall in the bathroom somewhere. Sigh, memories......."
450,2,How can I explain my love hate relationship with this place? I think the best way is that we have a need-based agreement of sorts. I need a coffee and I am not always ready to go into Starbucks and here is Kiva Han right across the street. Waiting. I have both shivered through a meal and sweat through a meal at this un-climate controlled cafe. The food is okay. It's filling and I like the hangover cure simply because I like all of my breakfast rolled up into an eggy pouch. Its afforable. Go some where else if you can. it's a decent social spot I have to say- again good location. I wish the owner would take it seriously.
451,1,"How should I begin?  I guess the good thing about this place is that it was very bright and clean.  But, the food was just not good.  I've been a vegetarian for 16 years, and I've rarely had worse.  We were so hungry when we arrived that cardboard would have tasted good, but, cardboard would have been better than that tamale!  The beans tasted like they were poured straight from a can - no seasoning- the rice was mush, the chili was bland and tasteless, and no amount of tabasco or salsa could make it good.  The hummus was OK...not real good, but good by comparison to the rest of the meal.  We had something else, but happily I've forgotten what it was.
This is the kind of vegetarian food that gives us a bad rep."
452,1,"Totally unprofessional.  Management was extremely aggressive, pushy, rude and all over the place.  The yarn is overpriced.  The mood is anything but cozy.

Note: After I wrote this, 4 new superlative first time reviews popped up in a week.."
453,1,"Waitress messed up both orders. French toast tried really hard to be ""something"" but it wasn't. I've had better pancakes from mcdonalds. Wanted to like this place but..."
454,2,A friend and I ate here last weekend.  We sat upstairs at the bar which was a really cool outside deck with a nice view of the city.  The whole downstairs felt really cold and uninviting.  It was dead for a friday night at 7:30 pm.  We were the only ones sitting at the bar and a small party on the couches and the service was terrible.  We had to ask 2 or 3 times for more water and all the servers/bartenders were just chatting with each other.  The food wasn't anything special.
455,2,"I find it comical that virtually no one giving this place a good review actually lives in RI.  Most locals stay out of Al Forno and leave it to the tourists.

Perhaps I'm just spoiled, but Al Forno is so overhyped it's mind-boggling.  The reviewer that not only compared it to Per Se, Gary Danko and The French Laundry, but said it was better, has got to be kidding.  They're in a completely separate league than Al Forno.

Al Forno has a quaint patio and damned good pizza.  For twenty bucks, dough with tomato, cheese and basil should be amazing.  The teeny plate of burned shells I received was not.  The apple tart everyone raves about it good, but basic.  The service has always been inept.

Fifteen years ago, this was THE spot.  It's just a dinosaur now."
456,2,"Steak N Shake seems to be on their game in playing to everyone hit with tough economic times by rockin' the $4 meals all over the place.  I'm not really sure this pricing is any different than before, but go marketing team!

They also had a weekend kids special where one kids meal comes free per $8 purchase, which is cool but were tragically out of the toys advertised in giant letters.  But at least they have crayons, right? No crayons! Our waitress eventually came through with one yellow crayon and some stickers which was nice of her.  

At checkout the free kids meal had to be requested off the check, which was done quickly and happily but still felt like another thing added on the endless meal of ""I'm sorry"". And I'd been to a Waffle House earlier that day so my expectations were unbelievably high."
457,1,Bland food. Not worth finding a parking spot on a one-way street.
458,2,"***Full Disclosure: I used to work for Flat Top Grill for nearly six years until April 2011, spanning its old and current ownership, but not at this location***

My buddy Sven and I came to town the other night and decided to stop in for dinner.  He had been eating unhealthily all day and we both knew that FTG was a place to both eat healthy and make yourself a large quantity of food for your money, if that's your sort of thing.

We stopped in around 8:30 on a Saturday night.  There appeared to be only one server, one bartender and a manager on the floor. The manager appeared to be wearing many hats, seating, serving and bussing tables.

Ok, most people are familiar with the process by now.  The food was good.  Our server Toni was good.  Honestly, the only reason I'm giving such a low rating is because the place looked like a disaster area.  It looked like a tour bus full of people had just left the place.  Dirty tables everywhere, trails of water and food debris all over the floor.  The bar area had 10 or so seats, with four of them covered by clipboards, paperwork, and other bar stuff.  While our server, the bartender and the manager are all trying to make some sense of the place, I head to the bathroom and the busboy is in the back of the room on his phone.

The spot in the worst shape was the food line.  There were veggies all over the counter, sauces splattered all over, a few items were missing tongs, and there was only one guy on a full grill on a Saturday night.

If you think about it, there's only one thing FTG offers, and that's the fresh food line.  If that looks unappealing, then the whole concept looks bad.  Someone with bad OCD that night would've probably had a Rain Man-style attack.

For all the times I visit Champaign (once a year), I'll write off this visit.  I've been to FTG's that are immaculate, and ones that need some work.  This one could definitely use a hand."
459,2,"Maybe I've been watching too much Master Chef, where angry fits and icy glares are appropriate responses to bad food, but this food was so bad it made me mad. (And rhyme, apparently...) I had the tom yum soup and crab fried rice. The tom yum was on the southern end of mediocre. The chicken was super dry and the broth was weirdly sweet. As for the misnamed crab fried rice, I felt jipped. It was actually an imitation crab fried rice. The only crab on the plate was a garnish-worthy amount sprinkled atop. Not cool. 

While we were eating, this man in the restaurant exclaimed to the owner, ""I can't stop eating. It's so good!"" That had me thoroughly stumped because my immediate thought was, uh, I can. And I'm pretty sure I will. (Here. Not in general. I still like food :)"
460,1,"It's been a few years since I've been back to Firestone Grill so I was stoked to visit again on a trip to SLO. This place normally gets 4 stars so the rating of 2 stars for this post if for the experience of that day. 

Food [4 stars normally, 2 stars for this visit]
1. Tri-tip sammy
     + Stacked with meat and bbq sauce, not skimming ya there
     -  Meat's a little dry, depending on where they cut it
     -  Bread can be overly buttered
2. Veggie Burger
     + Sprouts and tomatoes go nicely with the hot patty
     -  Wheat bread is a bit dry
3. Firestone's Salad
     + Feta, peppers, tomatoes = super fresh, flavors dripping in the juice
     -- Two negative signs because there was a piece of meat in the 
     salad (this was ordered for a vegetarian friend, yikes!)
4. Onion rings
     + Yummy batter
     -  Too much batter:onion ratio

Service [2 stars]
-  tables outside needed to be cleaned more often
+ Props for working those huge crowds with such efficiency though!

Final Call:
Don't get me wrong, Firestone's is a good place to grub (especially if you're into tri-tip or just good, grilled food). They just cross-contaminated a vegetarian dish with meat which is a no-no for veg-heads. Not being clean about the food hopefully does not imply public health issues. I'll visit again, but not with my vegetarian friends."
461,1,"It's not authentic Thai food AT ALL. The taste is TOTALLY NOT Thai. We ordered Pad Thai and Hot Spicy Noodle. The pictures of the food in the restaurant looked so good and delicious but the actual serving are opposite. I have to say this is the WORST Thai food that I've ever had. 

The soup that came with Pad Thai supposed to be ""Tom Kha Kai (Thai coconut chicken soup)"" but it was just coconut milk filled with soy sauce, salty and watery, YAK. 

The ingredients for both menu were NOT right so as the taste. They put something that was not supposed to be in e.g. dried garlic in Pad Thai and snow bean, bamboo shoot and jalapeno in the Hot Spicy Noodle. Some ingredients they supposed to put it in but they didn't for example, chili paste in the Hot Spicy Noodle. 

So in short, it is not Thai food. If they wanna make Thai food, please hire someone who really know how to cook Thai food.  

Please be brave to walk out if you feel it's not the right place for you so you won't regret it as we did."
462,2,"This place seems to have it's on and off days, some things are very tasty while others... is a creation that takes getting used to I suppose. the People of Princeton seem to be loyal and friendly with this place and it creates a nice vibe when entering the small restaurant, but it makes me feel more of an outsider than anything.

they serve this spicy tuna/salmon whatever it is mix with everything that tastes awful. 

If only they hadn't have raised prices and made sushi better, this would be a cute place to eat. I do not mind styrofoam plates for a hip place in Princeton where all the students go but the food makes me feel sick when I eat it."
463,2,"This place is in the Hyatt Regency and looks like it might have been a cool place to hangout in mid 80's ish.  At least the carpet and Simon Says looking background behind the bar speaks mid 80's ish to me.

The place and the hotel adjoining it are the same.  Both look really nice from the outside, great potential, you are excited when you walk inside...and then you see the inside.  If you aren't a hotel guest or hotel bar transient this isn't the place for you.

But...I must say that the help was great, chicken tortilla soup amazing and a pretty good vodka martini.  

They do have a little patio seating area outside that could have some potential on a nice evening."
464,1,"so i've been emailing back and fourth with the health board regarding my last post. this is what i got today regarding when the health board spoke to the corporate office, 

""I spoke with the corporate office in Orange County , and they said that each customer is allowed one sample only. And they would review if they should continue sampling (what the heck!!). They stated that the staff is to remind the sampling customer that only one sample is given. The office stated that they do not have to give samples, and do so as a courtesy. They stated that some customers want to sample all products (puh-lease). I stated that they should review their sampling procedures with their stores."" 

i'm grateful that we have the Health Board and to me I hear the Tutti-Frutti company saying that we are just hear to make as much money as possible and if it means cutting costs on customer service so be it. i personally worked at (2) golden spoons in orange county (many many moons ago) and this is just off in left field.


thank goodness there is yogurtland :D 
it's my happy place-really."
465,2,"If this restaurant was in a place with any visible competition it might be mediocre.  

I have been dragged here for dinner and lunch multiple times by people who act like it's the best thing since sliced bread.  Every time the food seems to have been slapped together with no attention to flavor.  The only thing that this place has going is size.  You get huge portions that IME always fall apart before you get them off your plate.

Worse yet I've seen multiple people get kicked out for no reason other than the owner is a snob.  And no, I haven't been kicked out personally.  I just dont see any reason to pay the inflated prices for a meal that is bland given the better alternatives in the area such as Heisei or Asahi."
466,1,"I had high hopes for this place, but I was sorely disappointed. The space itself is cool and the concept too. I don't like the white walls, but whatever. The front is disorganized chaos, but I liked the ordering system -- however, seriously guys -- the prices should include tax if you're trying to be neat and clean. $12.72 isn't exactly giving you good change, despite the menu being $2, $5, $3....

I had the butternut squash sandwich. It was vile. VILE! Just gross! No taste, not the right consistency, too salty, and the kale was not well done. The white bean spread was flavorless - they could have gone with a stronger smoked paprika instead or sweetened the squash so it's more chunky and maple-y. Maybe added crunch! Seems like their chefs have no talent for recipe design. The bread wasn't even fresh tasting. They should have rolled it into a warm wrap with FLAVOR. Come on people. Vegetarian food does not mean flavorless! Spice it up.

I also tried the hibiscus iced tea, which was okay. I am into alternative beverages, but I would actually go for a Starbucks passion-fruit tea over this one. 

Overall, gross. I would maybe go back and try their breakfast popovers because I love those ~~ quite disappointed!"
467,1,"Don't go there if you value your time, money or safety!!! Worst customer service experience I've ever had. They advertised a free month storage with one way truck rental. I called and confirmed. I confirmed online. I have proof that this is their policy. I showed up with my truck and they said they don't offer free storage. I called corporate several times who confirmed that they do. Then, they overcharged me for a returned vehicle that was left in better shape with MORE gas than I received it. The people at Cambridge were extremely rude and my girlfriend and I felt VERY UNSAFE in their presence. It is a creepy establishment. The general manager hung up the phone on me. They have no idea how to treat a customer, particularly one who was generally very understanding that they have boring jobs and long days in a gross location--this review is actually cutting them a lot of slack."
468,2,"With our usual anniversary spot Christophe's closed now, we were forced out into the wild to search for a new spot.  It being a Wednesday and meeting up with the wife around 6 I figured we'd just wing it and just select whatever we're in the mood for from a variety of bookmarks I've had for the area.  One of these was Viva Madrid and the menu looked interesting enough, so we decided to walk on over there.

It is back down this hallway back inside a building, but with their big sign out front on the sidewalk wasn't too hard to find.  Once we walked in we were surprised how busy this place was for a Wednesday around 6 with every table occupied.  I figured this was probably a good sign since why else would this many people be here at this time unless the food was that worth it.  

After about a 10 minute or so wait a table was vacated and cleared and we were seated.  We seriously waited around 20-25 minutes just for anyone to come by and even recognize we were there. At around 15 minutes we even started trying to catch the apparently only two waiters serving the place, but they wouldn't even look in our direction. I understand places can be busy, especially tapas places where people are constantly ordering more food, but this is such a frustrating way to start out a meal and difficult to recover. Like they say, you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.

Once we finally were waited on, we hurriedly ordered drinks and managed to squeeze in a handful of tapas (pan con tomate, melon con jamon, patatas bravas) to order before our waiter scurried off.  The pan con tomate (toasted bread with a marinara type sauce) arrived probably another 20 minutes later and we scaffed that down pretty quickly. Good, but basic.  The serrano ham with cantaloupe was interestingly presented with three skewers of melon balls with ham on them stuck into a wedge of melon, but for only three little pieces of ham this was pretty disappointing.  The patatas bravas certainly didn't lie about the spicy part of the tomato sauce. Not overwhelmingly spicy, but certainly too much for the wife. Still, not very interesting.

For our second round when we caught our waiter again, we ordered a basket of bread with olive oil and vinegar, the jamon y queso, and bacon wrapped dates.  I believe the bacon wrapped dates arrived first, which upon first look were extremely overcooked with a charred exterior and not looking all that appetizing.  After letting them cool down considerably, they were actually pretty tasty with a great salty and sweet flavor and without an expected char taste from they way they looked.  Bread... what is there to really say about basic bread?  The jamon y queso was pretty good as well with a great manchego that reminded me of a young, soft parmesan.  The serrano ham was silky smooth and had a good bit of smoky funky flavor.  The chorizo, montecerdo, and olives were tasty as well.  I was still feeling a little short of full, so I decided to order the beef with garlic and wine, but after about 20 minutes or so it didn't show up and or waiter simply asked us if we wanted dessert, so I gave up on the beef and we moved onto ordering a chocolate mousse cake.  This was one item that did arrive relatively promptly within about 10 minutes.  It was pretty darn good too, with a heavy mousse that wasn't too rich with just the right bit of chocolate flavor and a good thick chocolate crust that seemed to have a bit of salt in it that really made the dish for me.

The food and service did slowly start to improve while we were there, but overall there was nothing that I could say, ""that was really good"" that I'd want to go back for.  With an extensive menu like they have, its easy to miss things that you wish you would've ordered and upon our second round of ordering I really should've just asked the waiter what he'd recommend so I didn't miss anything that truly could've been spectacular since he did seem knowledgeable.  In the end our bill came and although it was somewhat difficulat to decifer, it appeared that our waiter knocked off one or maybe even two of our dishes hopefully to make up for the poor service.  Fortunately that rescued him from me feeling a little better at the end and giving him a tip that reflected his second half performance instead of his first half.  

I wish I could really like this place with its small, cozy, but vibrant atmosphere and frankly the prices are actually fairly decent.  Maybe I'm missing the point of this place a bit in that you are supposed to always try and flag your waiter down instead of them waiting on you like a standard restaurant, but that is not the experience I'm into and I'm glad to avoid restaurants that subscribe to this type of service as regular.  However, food is first, service is second, and environment is third in my book. So, if you're not getting the first two accomplished, what does the third matter?"
469,2,"Went to TT's last night for rock and roll rumble. The bouncers were the rudest I have ever experienced. (for the record I was sober and generally normal, i understand that sometimes bouncers need to be rude). We were told to stand single file even though there was plenty of room and that meant that I had to stand outside. At will call the guy yelled at my man that he was not allowed to move to the side and then was all exasperated that there wasn't a second person with him for the second ticket. I was there, he just couldn't see me because there seems to be a very strict rule involving standing two abreast in the hallway. Conversely we went out after about an hour and when we came back one of the bouncers was flirting and we had to stand around waiting for someone to verify our hand stamp-also worth noting that the will call guy didn't give me a chance to move my sleeve and mostly he stamped my jacket. I would've been pretty pissed but my jacket is dark. The point being, why all hard ass at 9:00 and then all lackadaisical at 10:00. It started me off on the wrong foot. 
Now is the real problem with TT's. They are above another club, which means whatever you listening to is being filtered through dance music. Last night I was there to see Cult 45, who is pretty hard rocking, so mostly I noticed the vibrations. The last time I was at TT's was for AA Bondy who is a quieter rootsier act. I could very audibly hear the conflicting music. 
I went for 2 stars instead of the minimum because the minimum is for places you would never return to and I would go there again to see a band I really wanted to see, especially if they were hard enough to play over the dance music. It just seems like they could sound proof the club underneath. It really hurts the experience"
470,1,"We ordered the $10 box with a cheese pizza. It came with a pepperoni pizza. We called to tell them that we did not get what we ordered, so the manager agreed to send over another with a cheese pizza. So far, so good.

Except when the delivery guy showed up again, he wanted to take the pepperoni pizza that we had opened and continue delivering it. It makes me wonder if it's ever happened before. I'm not cool with getting pizza that's been delivered to someone else, so I'll pick another Pizza Hut next time.

As for the food, it was pretty standard for a Pizza Hut. That $10 box is a good deal."
471,2,"Huge portions but am not a fan. Went on a weekday afternoon. They do offer big portions of salad and their complimentary bread is delicious. I was not very happy with the entrees. I had ordered some sautéed chicken dish with rice and it was a poor attempt I'd say. Didn't like it all.
The 2 stars are for the good salad n bread and our server was nice. That's all. I don't plan to go back. I have had super delish Mediterranean food elsewhere!!! You failed LA MARSA!!!!"

473,1,"Coming from Boston where asian cusine is in abundance, I realize that I may come off a bit rude but...

This place was SUCH a disappointment!! Years ago when I was in the Cranston area, I used to venture to this spot almost twice a week for my Thai cravings as I couldn't/*still cannot* find decent asian food anywhere in the area (someone PLEASE recommend a good spot!!). 

After relocating back home to Boston for a while, I have moved back to RI and knew that Spice was HOPEFULLY a good last minute choice. NOPE!

Not only did they get our order wrong, but they threw away our leftovers.

We ordered:
Veggie tempura--way over-fried and dry, dipping sauce tasted old
BF ordered Kra Pow--chicken was rubbery, sauce tasted cheap and old
I ordered Bulgoki with BEEF--they gave me chicken which was disgusting.

After telling the waitress that they messed up my order she proceeded to roll her eyes and walk away, ""oh soorrry""... wtf? Apologize, offer something different, I say ""no it's fine"", I eat it, all is well.

Then after all of that, the waiter threw away our leftovers after we CLEARLY said, ""CAN YOU BOX THESE UP, PLEASE?""

Yes I get it--they get REALLY busy, they're REALLY small, they're in college hill blah blah blah.. no excuses. I have no tolerance for poor service, poor food, and inconsistency. If the food and atmosphere were better, I would have NO problem with crappy service, but they're not.

Do yourself a favor and go grab a couple slices at Antonio's instead."
474,1,"I heard a friend of a friend found a roach in her food. I almost cried. I decided to check out the health department report.

Well, when I first went I loved the noodles too, but don't want to risk another visit."

The trick is though, you have to finish every single bit of rice on your dish or else you will have to pay a penalty for not finishing your food. (Quite ridiculous, considering they put too much rice in the sushi as it is)

The only other reason why i came here is because my boyfriend used to live in the Left Bank, and when we craved Japanese food and did not want to wait for more then 15 minutes, this was the place to get it. Despite the rude service and less than mediocre Japanese food."

Worst part, they didn't even have ""HOT SAUCE""!!!"

Allen: Walking into the UCLA Bookstore is the same as walking into prison with your pants down and cheeks spread. Either way, you know you gonna get butt raped. Like a sucker, I came here during the first quarter of freshmen year to buy my textbook. My total was around $200, and they were all used books too. The fuck you doing charging 80 dollars for a used Economics textbook. Little did I know, I can get that same book brand new on Amazon for 80 dollars. 

Naive Freshmen: But Allen, you get those cool coupons where they give you like 4 oz. of free candy from Ackerman Candy store!

Allen: Fuck those coupons. I can shit out 4 oz. of candy! Those candy ain't free you dumbass. They charged you 100 dollar for you art history book that you will only use once. 

Naive Freshmen: But they will buy it back at the end of the quarter... guarantee!

Allen: My god, you must of be a crack baby or something. They'll buy it back... for like 10 bucks. I rather keep the book and use the pages to wipe my ass. 

Naive Freshmen: Man, fuck you! Stop insulting me. At least when I buy it from the UCLA store, I can get it on that day. 

Allen: Hmm.. you present a interesting argument, but this is why you are wrong. Free amazon prime 2 days delivery. I can get my book in two days AND it'll be shipped to my front door. You want to keep defending the UCLA Bookstore?

Naive Freshmen: No sir. You are right in every way. What about course readers. I can't get those on Amazon. I heard the only place I can get it is at Course Reader Material.

Allen: Don't you EVER fucken mention Course Reader Material! That place is the creation of Hitler and Satan run by people of a certain  descent that really enjoy taking you money.

it sucks to get an employee that doesn't want to be there. July  8, 2010 at 8:15 pm. He was working the register with no name tag. 

Nobody needs to be treated like crap. I won't be back."
480,1,"Vine is a model as to what can go wrong in the rebranding process. I was never the biggest fan of Swish, but their attempt to relaunch their business, which should have been a success with the disastrous Ollie's next door and the closing of Tomo and Tokyo Pop, has failed for one huge reason: the food stinks.

While I applaud the decor, in improving their image they must have decided that no one actually pays attention to what they're eating. Since their reopening, I've been dying to try -- Tomo was always too expensive for my tastes and there isn't any good sushi within walking distance. Well, I finally had my chance so my gal and I ordered some classic favorites: yaki udon with beef, miso soup, and for rolls we deigned on eel avocado and shrimp tempura. The udon was horrendous (her words). Aside from being just. . . bland in flavor, they somehow managed to overcook the beef and undercook the vegetables. It was a party of unwelcome textures. I know beef -- aside from being overcooked, it was sliced with the grain, leading to stringy, tough and unpalatable protein. The presentation was the same as ever: plop!

The sushi was also somehow disappointing, even though there's no reason why it should have changed. Swish always had mediocre sushi but I never was able to pinpoint the problem. This time it was clear: watery and just a bit too warm. Furthermore, the shrimp tempura lacked some defining flavor, while the eel avocado was simply okay.

No problem with the miso; I might have left sooner if there had been.

The initial awe and wonder you experience when first passing the sushi bar and fancy front counter wears off quickly, and you really start to nitpick on your surroundings. While the design is cohesive and clean, as you look around you start to realize that you're sitting on top of someone else's conversation. That's not a new problem, but one less table might have made a world of difference when it comes to breathing room. Somehow, this place is always packed, though, so I guess removing tables is the last thing on the minds of Vine's management.

One improvement? The waitstaff doesn't chase you out the door when you don't tip at least 15%. If I were coming just for the quick service, it'd be five stars. But at these prices, I don't think I'll be back for what they're serving."
481,1,"I have been to this Sephora many times. Its fine if you want to quickly pick up stuff you know you need but I would never bother to ask the store staff for advice on products! I went in and asked for suggestions regarding my skin the first time round and got some really bad suggestions that totally did not work on my skin. Second time round I asked for an eye pencil suggestion since they were out of my favorite Stila. I made it clear I wanted something dark. One of the staff lady swore by a particular type she said was amazing. I bought it. It was horrible. It barely showed on my eyes. I have olive skin so its not a complexion thing. Finally, I gave them a last try one frantic evening when I really needed quick make up. I asked for a suggestion on a good mascara because they didn't have the one I wanted. Again, the suggestion was so bad, the lashes are barely darkened.

So overall I would say, its an okay store but the staff has no idea what they are recommending."
482,1,Bunch of racist bitches! I will never shop there again. I'm letting my friends and family know so they will not bring business. I have never been treated so poorly in my life.

My girlfriend went to pick up her xrays so we could go to a different dentist.  When she got there, the front desk assistant politely pulled her aside into another room, were they proceeded to (politely) ask her about MY review and why I was dissatisfied.  I'm sorry, but if they wanted to ask about a review, yelp has a feature for that and they should not discuss that with someone who did not write a review!  Although my gf did appreciate that they were trying to find out what was wrong, she was still weirded out.  I stand by my original rating.

Now, 2 months later, the SORDID STORY CONTINUES!  I just received a bill from them!  My UCSD GSHIP insurance is supposed to cover 100% of prophylactic exams, which is what I went there for.  So why did I just receive a bill.... hmmm?  I will update when I have this resolved.

Needless to say, avoid this place like the plague.  The tooth plague.

484,1,"I've been a loyal Magnolia patron through the years but unfortunately had an experience last night that put an end to my Magnolia days.

My boyfriend and I arrived around 7pm planning on having dinner and drinks.  Magnolia does not have a hostess/hostess stand so we took the liberty of seating ourselves.  After having been seated for over 10-15 minutes we'd decided on the drinks, entrees AND desserts we wanted.  We closed the menus and looked at each other wondering if anyone was every going to stop by and take our orders.

We saw multiple staffers running back and forth with frazzled/confused looks on their faces yet no one managed to take the time to stop and ask if we'd been taken care of.  Finally my boyfriend put both his hands in the air to get the attention of someone scrambling by us.  Without any sort of apology the employee told us he'd send someone over.

We sat and waited for 5...10...15.... minutes before deciding that there was definitely no way anyone was every going to help us.

My experience at Magnolia was so embarrassing/strange I wondered if maybe I was dreaming.  Unfortunately I will not be testing my luck at this place ever again.  BOO!"
485,1,"While the food served was flavorful and nicely prepared. This was not true Chinese cuisine.  It was Chinese for Americans ... and incorporated other Asian fusion elements. That meant that my dim sum was flat tasting and the spicy shrimp ... wasn't.  

Service was slow, the main dish came out before the appetizers, and my Peking Duck roll was cold (not supposed to be).

My glass of wine was so small they used a sherry glass ... and prices were inflated.

Overall ... not a place I will return to or recommend."
486,1,"By signing up on the Quiznos website I received a coupon to print; the store locator confirmed that the location would accept it.

The lady who began preparations on my sandwich was very pleasant, albeit extremely stingy with the ingredients; I ordered a veggie, no cheese, and watched stupefied as she sprinkled veritable crumbs of onions and mushrooms onto the bread.  The woman who completed preparing my sandwich was worse: it was actually amusing to watch her try to spread a thimble-full of guacamole on my otherwise barren sandwich.  

When it came time to pay, the second person eyed my coupon warily.  I handed it to her and she told me that they don't accept ""copies"".  Although I explained that the coupon was a printout of an email I had received less than an hour prior, she continued to insist that they don't accept ""copies""- holding up a coupon from a mailer as an example of what she would accept.  

I tried one final time to explain before I realized I was begging to purchase an over-priced, empty sandwich from a shop that had absolutely no interest in my business.  I layed my chips on the counter, told her to keep the sandwich and the coupon, and proceeded to drive out of my way to a Subway where I received superior service and product at a lower price even without a coupon.  

I have no way of knowing if all Quiznos would offer a similarly horrendous experience, but this leaves me no reason to test the theory."
487,1,"What a ripoff!

I went to go get a cheeseburger to go, took it home, opened it up, and there was NO CHEESE.  I couldn't taste any cheese, and I couldn't see any cheese.  So I call them up and the lady talks to the cook and she says ""No, he put the cheese on, you just can't see it"".

Hold on right here.  Can't see the cheese? WTF? Is this invisible cheese? Disappearing cheese? Yeah right, lady.

So I say ""NO, I can't see ANY cheese, and I can't TASTE the cheese, and I have it right in front of me"".  And she tells me ""No, he put it on, we know, it's there you just can't see it.""

So I'm just ready to blow at this woman, because I already paid for an overpriced cheeseburger and now I'm told they only serve invisible cheese?  I say goodnight and hang up, and I will never ever go to Bongo Burger again, it was a mistake going there this time.

WELL, COOK SOME F'ing TENDERS  THEN YOU DUMB ARSES!!! Bahhh, I drove away with nothing and I was f'ing hungry!"
489,1,"Note to Bands--DO NOT PLAY HERE.  IT IS NOT WORTH IT.  Imagine a bar that's a good, say four hours away, that asks you to play as a 'house band' for a night.  But a week and a half before the gig, they call you and say ""Oh, by the way, we don't have a PA.  Can you bring one?""  So you make more arrangements to find a bigger PA than your band's rehearsal one.  You cart everything to the show.  You set up the PA, and all other band/sound equipment.  After a three hour set--F&P Figures your time, music, and customers you brought in were worth exactly $0.

Musicians--avoid this place like the plague.  There are many people with no respect for music, and try to take advantage of bands.  Frog and Peach is definitely on this list.

Oh yeah, and the bartenders are dicks to band members.  And despite the crappy remodel the vaulted ceilings don't do anything but catch heat and BO you just have to deal with it.  And don't expect to use the bathroom if you packed the place.  You won't be able to reach them.

All in all--F this place."

We headed down orded the 5$  pizza special and the sausage  pepper and onion pizza
 we pick up and immediately have a slice

This pizza is exactly like Digiorno's pizza fluffy  crust with no flavor and actually sort of gummy .. like undercooked.
Yes Digiorno's, the kind you get at the supermarket frozen
 Too much basil, cheese was sparse. The sauce.. nonexistent adn no taste. So much so  we went home and actually  dipped the pizza in Ragu pizza sauce to give it some flavor

ok, the teller service is normal- and compared to other banks I admit it's convenient to not have to fill out those silly forms with the amount of money you want to deposit. 

but if you make a mistake with my credit card and then lie to me about the special promotion AND i catch the lie and I come back to complain, don't try to make up excuses and shift blame-just admit your mistakes! a simple apology would have sufficed, but it angers me when you sit there making up excuses and then offer to get me extra points on my rewards  WITHOUT ASKING FOR MY NAME before I leave. and yes, I did notice that you gave another customer a free water bottle because you ALSO made a mistake with his account - but offered me nothing. nice customer service there."

Pho arrived with two small pieces of broccoli, and a handful of cabbage that literally look like it had been thrown in. Broth was weak on flavor and too salty. With so many good pho places in town, I'll definitely go elsewhere."
494,1,"AWFUL!!!  Stopped by to grab some baked goodies b/c I had a scoutmob.  Customer service was TERRIBLE... no signs to tell you what the different desserts were and the lady literally rolled her eyes at us when we asked.  It was so obvious, I thought she was kidding... but nope!  So rude!  And I believe the manager was working right behind her and didn't seem to mind the way she was acting.  We used our scoutmob which was 50% off, and our total bill for one cupcake and a cookie was STILL $3.  I will and have spent far more than that on desserts, so that's not my issue... my issue is that the cupcake was DISGUSTING.  Like not kind of disgusting, but spit-it-out-in-a-napkin-so-I-don't-digest-it disgusting!  You will leave here dissatisfied."

I could go on but I think that says enough."
496,1,"I don't get the hype about this place.  Maybe it's more of a drunken 2 am kind of joint??

We went for lunch today.  My husband got the wings and I got a veggie burger and fries.  The wings and fries came out about a minute after we sat down.  I've made wings and fries before at home and know for a fact they both take more than 1 minute to make.  Obviously they were sitting around from who knows when.  My husband said the chicken had a weird texture as well.  The fries were soggy.

The veggie burger was clearly microwaved.  I am pretty sure I saw a grill in the back, so why not toss it on there?  It was a mushy mess with no flavor.  

Thank god for Olives bakery and the cupcake place around the corner where we could get something edible."
497,1,"Nothing good about this place really. I thought it would be awesome but I'm fairly certain they don't make anything from scratch here. The noodles and broth tasted like they came from a box. If you like these noodles then you probably don't know what good noodles are. So bland and flavorless. 

The only reason I would consider going back is if they halved the prices and I needed a Ramen fix. Honestly even then it would take a lot to convince me, I'm pretty sure I could make better tasting ramen from the 25¢ packages. 

It's always crowded (I'm guessing because it just opened, I don't know who would go back) and the service wasn't great. Honesty just stick to the other sushi/ Japanese places in SLO, they are way better."
498,1,"Let me tell you that the majority of workers at this post office are lazy. I work from my apartment, so when I go check the mail, it is beyond annoying to see that ""Sorry we missed you!"" slip right inside the mailbox when you've been home ALL DAY. 
To be honest, it is MORE WORK for the ridiculous mail-man to write out everything on that slip than to drive down, get out of the car and within 30 seconds time, knock on my door to deliver the package.
I have to say that this ""clean"" portion of my review does not fully express how I feel, so let me add that they need to clean the F*** out of that SH***Y AS* post office, and put some people that actually WANT to work and earn a living but can't because all the lazy AS*H*LES are the ones taking up the employment."
499,1,"Three things I hate most in a restaurant are:
-Bland ""faux-ethnic"" food
-Weak drinks
-Slow, inattentive service

Chu-Cho's managed to hit the trifecta, all in my first visit!

What's worse, they're also overpriced.  For $50 in Blacksburg, I expect MUCH more than watery margaritas, tasteless tacos, and a one-hour wait for the appetizer.

Don't bother."
500,1,"The cookies taste like Mrs. Field's cookies, and the ice cream is nothing special.  I don't understand the hype.  It's a great concept, but executed poorly.  

The saving grace is that this is super cheap, but there's a reason why it's so cheap.  

Please give me an It's-It's ice cream cookie instead."
